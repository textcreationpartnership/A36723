            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Art of Perſpective, which hath the eye for its Principle, to whom Nature hath given more vivacity and more Perfections then to the other ſenſes, and which holdeth amongſt them the Rank, and the Advantages that the Soul hath above the Body, is likewiſe the faireſt and moſt delightful of all the Parts, that the Science of the Mathematicks hath put forth into light. This Science may well boaſt it ſelf to be the ſoul and the life of Painting, ſeeing that it is it which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth unto Painters the Perfection of their Art, which in its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the heights and the meaſures of the Figures, the Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, the Architectures, and other Ornaments of a Picture: It inſtructeth what colours he ſhould uſe, lively or ſad, in what place he ought to apply the one and the other, what he ought to finiſh, and what ought not ſo to be: where one is to give a light, and where there is no need of it: in a word, it is this that ought to begin and finiſh, ſeeing that it ought to go throughout all. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out help, the beſt Maſter will make as many faults as draughts, principally in Architectures, wherewith they would enrich their Works, as I have ſeen in Pieces well eſteemed, where they have failed ſo foully, that this in part hath been the motive of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, for to cauſe them to know their errours without naming them, and to teach the young ones to avoid them. How excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a Painter ſoever one is, he muſt obſerve all theſe Rules, or he ſhall content none but Ignorants, and a Reaſonable Painter that ſhall know and uſe theſe well, ſhall do wonders to every ones con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:59268:3"/>The Engraver in Copper ought not to be more ignorant of it then the Painter, ſeeing that he doth that with his Graver, which the other doth with his Pencil: It will make him to know that which he ought to touch toughly, and that which he ought to make faint. The need that he hath of this Science is ſo much the more neceſſary, as his Pieces are far more in number, then thoſe of the Painter: the which if they be skilfully made, his praiſe is encreaſed: if on the contrary, his defects are thereby the more known, and every Piece is a Mouth which decrieth its Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>The Carver in Boſs ſhall learn the height which he muſt give to his Statues, as well for below as for the midſt, and in proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to that which is higher, what Projector he muſt give to Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to other Bodies that have Mouldings or demi-Boſs, the Angle for the point of the ſight, for to take the heights and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgements of all the Objects near and far off.</p>
            <p>The Architect by this Science, may be able to give the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of his deſignes in a ſmall ſpace, he may alſo elevate one part, and leave the other in Plane, for to make his whole work ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; and ſeeing that we are upon Architecture, there needeth that the Perſpective, (or he that profeſſeth this,) be learned therein, at leaſt in the Practice of the Hand, by reaſon that the faireſt Pieces of Perſpective are made in rich and ſumptuous Buildings, framed according to the Orders of Columns, the Beauty of which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth on Proportions and Meaſures, which ought to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved therein, otherwiſe they will offend the eye; wherefore they ought to be well ſtudied, and whoſoever knoweth them not when he ought to know them, is worthy of blame, ſeeing the eaſineſs that he hath to learn them, having <hi>Vitruvius, Vignola, Scamozzii,</hi> and many other which have written thereof ſo pertinently.</p>
            <p>It is not enough that he knows the Orders of Columns, he muſt underſtand all the Meaſures which are ordinarily given to Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to each particular thing, Gates, Windows, Chimneys, &amp;c. and to place them well, and to take days fit for the purpoſe, that he make not any thing like one eye or maimed, to take great care that every thing be right, nothing faulty, and that the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry and proportion be kept, as much as one is able, otherwiſe
<pb facs="tcp:59268:3"/>
the Perſpective, which is made for to content the ſight, would offend it by its defects.</p>
            <p>Goldſmiths, Embroiderers, Makers of Tapiſtry, Painters, workers in Silver, in Silk, and in Wool; Joyners, and all others that buſie themſelves in making deſignes, and with Painting, cannot let paſs this Science, of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective, if they would do any thing that may be commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>The moſt part of thoſe I have known to affect this Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, have aſſured me, that they have been beaten off by the great number of lines, that ſome Authors have ſet for to frame and finde the place of their Objects, Bodies, or Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures; others, by having met with too much obſcurity in their Orders and Explications, and particularly, for that they have not ſet the Inſtructions over againſt the Figures, and that whilſt that they turn over leaves to finde them, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat that which they deſired to know. All theſe Complaints oblige me to be more clear, and more Methodical in the Inſtructions which I have ſet before every figure, that they might have before them the Manner to ſet into Practice that which they deſire, applying my ſelf to their capacity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving ſuch Demonſtrations as would obſtruct or hinder them rather then clear them, uſing words which all may be able to underſtand, even in the Definitions, as one may ſee at the ſeventh fol. Having alſo given to certain things quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which the common ſort give to them, though that in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect they have them not. As for example, at the 15th. fol. where <hi>I</hi> diſcourſe of the diſtance or removal far off, <hi>I</hi> have been conſtrained to ſay, againſt my thought, that it is the Apple of the eye which receiveth the Rays of the Objects, as if they were bounded there, by reaſon that <hi>I</hi> have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimented that when <hi>I</hi> ſay that the Viſion is made upon the Retine, or fifth thin Membrane, at the bottom of the eye, that the Rays do but paſs by the Apple, and that the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
<pb facs="tcp:59268:4"/>
or ſpecies of that which we behold are turned back; it ſeemeth to me that <hi>I</hi> ſpeak a new language, and that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive that. Wherefore having conſidered that this knowledge did little import for the Practice of this Art: <hi>I</hi> gave to the Apple that which appertaineth to the bottom of the eye, which is the true place of the viſion or ſight, where the ſpecies of the Objects are framed although others ſay that it is in the Criſtalline: Thoſe which would be reſolved in this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may look into <hi>Aquilton Scheiner</hi> and <hi>des Cartes,</hi> which have ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well diſcourſed thereof.</p>
            <p>Although <hi>I</hi> have uſed all diligence poſſible, for to render this Science very eaſie, yet <hi>I</hi> doubt not but many may finde trouble therein at the beginning; but he which ſhall be able to ſurmount the difficulties, which he ſhall finde at the firſt; there is nothing which he may not underſtand and practice, ſo that he be careful to underſtand well, and retain one Order, before that he turn over the leaf: becauſe that they are, as it were linked together, and dependent the one of the other: this little pains will give the ſatisfaction, by the eaſineſs which one ſhall have afterwards, in making all whatſoever he would.</p>
            <p>It ſhall be known by the Table following, that this Book ſufficeth for to make all ſorts of Perſpectives, by uſing the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which the Figures and Letters ſhall ſhew, the which one may bring together to have that which one deſireth, in which he that would make ſome fair Perſpective, ſhall be delighted to find preſently that which he ſhall conceive will content his minde: and then he ſhall have far more delight then if he copied a Piece wholly made by another; and if one be conſtrained to imitate any one, this ſhall be done with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, ſeeing that there are here orders, of all that poſſibly he can meet with. I confeſs freely that I have an incredible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in making of new deſigns, and in inventing of new pieces
<pb facs="tcp:59268:4"/>
which I would have publiſhed, as others have done, had it not been that my deſire is, that every one ſhould be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of this Recreation which he may take in compoſing them, &amp; making them himſelf, having given him all the means, and the orders for to bring the ſame to paſs. But if any one will not take this as pains, he ſhall find many of them all made already in <hi>Marolois, Uredeman, Urieſſe,</hi> and others, which have taken delight to make their ingenuity appear therein.</p>
            <p>So many, ſo fair, and excellent works have ſerved to make ſome Painters lazy, that they will not learn to make that which they found already made; they are content only to deſign thoſe the beſt that they are able, and as far as they underſtand them, the which would be tolerable, if they did imitate them well; but counterfeiting them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out underſtanding, they make nothing that is good, giving ordinarily ſo many points in a Picture, as they ſhall meet with objects therein, lines and returns, they will make you ſee the under part of a thing, which as a certain one hath very well ſaid, ſteal from particulars that which they give to the publick, to draw glory to themſelves from the labour of others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> had rather ſay freely, that <hi>I</hi> intending to make this little Treatiſe of Perſpective; <hi>I</hi> would ſee, as far as I could, thoſe which had written thereof, and take from one and others, that which might ſerve for my ſubject, afterwards to make a General Reſtitution, with which <hi>I</hi> have mingled a little of mine own, for to bind them together, and to follow an Order, which they had forgot to keep. The firſt that <hi>I</hi> found to have given ſome light to this Science, is <hi>George Reich,</hi> an <hi>High-Germane,</hi> in the tenth Book of his Works: After him <hi>Viator,</hi> a Cannon of Toul, which hath
<pb facs="tcp:59268:5"/>
given ſtore of good Figures, but too little Inſtructions. After him came <hi>Albert Durer,</hi> an excellent man, which hath left ſome Rules and Principles amongſt his Works in the fourth Book of his Geometry: <hi>John Couſin</hi> alſo hath made a Book thereof, wherein there are many good things. After thoſe came <hi>Daniel Barbaro, Vignola, Serlto, du Cerean, Sirigary, Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon de Caus, Marolois, Uredement, Urieſſe, Guidus Ubaldus, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etro, Acolti, le Sieur de Vaulizard, le Sieur Deſargues,</hi> and lately the Reverned <hi>P. Niceron a Minime,</hi> whom <hi>I</hi> have ſeen all, the one after the other, admiring their ſtudy and pains, for to ſerve the Publick, eſteeming my ſelf much honoured to imitate that which they done, and to be the unknown Copier of their Works, beſides thoſe which I have named; there are many other brave ſpirits, which have written thereon, which I have not had the happineſs to ſee, becauſe I could not attain to it This Multitude of Authors cauſeth ſufficiently to underſtand, that this Science hath been in all times cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and eſteemed by the moſt curious ſpirits, and more in that age that we are in, then in any other paſs'd, the which maketh me to hope, that this little work will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe many, ſeeing that it bringeth Inſtructions, which have not been ſeen for ſetting into Perſpective, that which falleth ordinarily under the ſenſes, and by conſequence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the manner of making all ſorts of Perſpectives which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one can imagine.</p>
            <p>I deſire to proceed to cauſe it to be ſeen, and to teach to ſet into Perſpective all that may be ſet into it, not only in Pieces level, and upon an united Plane, but alſo the bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, round and oblique, as for to paint within Roofs, fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings or rais'd Works, Corners and Turnings again, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to appear ſquare, or round, that which it ſhall not be. In one word, all the Rarities and Deceits of Perſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, whereof theſe ought to come forth firſt, being the ſuondations and principles of thoſe which muſt follow.

If <hi>I</hi> ſhall know that they may be pleaſing, and that they are look'd upon with a courteous eye, it ſhall be ſuch a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſatisfaction to me, as <hi>I</hi> hope not for, and which ſhall eaſily compel me to acquit my ſelf of my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</p>

            <head>A TABLE, Inſtructing how to find the pieces that may ſerve to make any part of Perſpective.</head>
            <p>THe Art of Perſpective ought to begin by the planes, and according to reaſon, by thoſe that are the moſt eaſie, amongſt the which the ſquare, or the Cube; is the moſt eaſie, you may find how the plane thereof ought to be made, at the 19th. fol. and its elevation, at the 44th. and 49th. folios. If one would have it ſeen by the Angle, its plane is at the 20th fol. and its elevation at the 50th. fol.</p>
            <p>For to elevate the Walls of an Houſe, or Hedge-Rows for a Garden, you muſt take the 51th and 52th fol. and you ſhall find there, with the planes the manner of elevating them.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that would have the in-ſide of a Chamber, or of an Hall ſeen by the Front, ſhall find firſt the Walls, as we ſhall ſhew in the 51th and 52th fol. The Leaf following will give you the Doors, and the 54th fol. will ſhew how to make the Windows there. For to raiſe the Chimneys in what place ſoever you would, you muſt ſeek the 77th fol. After that you muſt lay there the Planchers, which may be found in the 55th and 57th fol? for the Pavements, there are of many ſorts in the <hi>31. 32. 33.</hi> and 34th. fol? If one would have open Doors, the 93th fol. will ſhew how to do it, and the Leaf following ſhall be for opening the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows. When there ſhall be two or three Stories, or Chambers, the one above the other, you muſt always keep the ſame Orders, and there ought to be but one only point for the view, as you may ſee in the <hi>76</hi> fol. for to aſcend into theſe Chambers there is an Aſcent turning, or Stairs in the <hi>82. 83. and 84</hi> fol.</p>
            <p>Ordinarily all the Buildings which are viewed by the inſide, are garniſhed with ſome Moveables, he that will place ſuch there, ſhall find of all ſorts in the 96th fol. and ſo forword unto the <hi>103</hi> fol. For the meaſures of ſuch Figures, if any ſuch ore to be placed there, they are to be found in the 122th. or 125th fol.</p>
            <p>For to make a Church appear by the inſide, we muſt firſt reſolve upon a plane, and place that in the Perſpective, according to the two orders, that we have given
<pb facs="tcp:59268:8"/>
thereupon in the 37th or 41th fol. You muſt raiſe the Walls, as is to be ſeen in the 51th fol. For the Windows, one may make them as the Arches of the 62th fol. or as in the 54th fol Except that there is no need of the croſs-bars, and that they muſt be round above. If one would have Pilaſters, or Pillers, they are to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ound in the 48th fol. If one would have Columns there, he muſt take the Order for them from the 87th fol. After all that there muſt be made a bending Roof, or Roofs, if one would ſet it upon the ſides fol. <hi>68. 69. 70. 71. and 72.</hi> will furniſh you with all ſorts thereof.</p>
            <p>The Ridge or top of the Church is made after another manner then bending ſides, the Order for that may be found at the 74th fol. for to enrich it with Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes, Mouldings and other Ornaments, you muſt have recourſe to the <hi>88. 89. 90. 91. and 92.</hi> fol. for Altars, if one would have them there, you ſhall find the Method of making them in the <hi>104</hi> fol In the midſt of the croſs-bars of the Church one may make a Lanthorn or Cubeloe, as is to be ſeen in the <hi>75.</hi> fol. The Pavement may be choſen in the <hi>31. 32. 33. and 34</hi> fol.</p>
            <p>As for the Buildings without ſide of the Doors and Windows, they are made like the Buildings in the in-ſide, in the <hi>53 and 54.</hi> fol. as may be ſeen in the <hi>106.</hi> fol. When you ſhall have elevated them to the height that you think fit, you ſhall find the draught there to raiſe ſuch a kind of covering, as you ſhall think muſt fitting in the <hi>107.</hi> or <hi>103.</hi> fol. If one would have there any Corniſh, or other Ornaments, you may find how they ought to be placed in the fol. <hi>88. 89. 90. 91 and 92.</hi> Galleries Arch-wiſe, either for the out-ſide or in-ſide may be found in the fol. <hi>63. 66 67. and 106.</hi> He that would make a whole ſtreet of Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, he muſt multiply the houſes, and place them on the one ſide, and on the other, as one may ſee in fol. <hi>109.</hi> When one ſhall make houſes at a diſtance in the Perſpectives, and that they ſhall be parallel to the Horizon, you ought to allow them the ſingle draught only, without the thickneſs f the Doors or the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows as I have made at the <hi>110</hi> fol. In the large open places, which are ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily in Streets in Perſpective, one may raiſe a Pyramide there, the <hi>80</hi> fol. will ſhew how to elevate it, upon ſteps, or any other figure, or Statue, upon a Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtal, the <hi>91</hi> fol. will furniſh the Piedeſtal, and the <hi>124</hi> fol. will ſhew the figure.</p>
            <p>When one would have Buildings ſeen by the left Angle he may take the planes of the fol. <hi>19. 30.</hi> and make the Elevations as he ſhall find them in the fol. <hi>50.</hi> and <hi>111.</hi> which ſhall give Orders, how to make the Doors and Windows there.</p>
            <p>Gardens made in Perſpective do more delight the ſight then any thing in the World, as well for the colour, that is ſo pleaſing there, as for the variety of things, which may be ſet there. The planes are to be made, as in the fol. <hi>35. 38.</hi> or <hi>113.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:59268:8"/>
In the which one may make ſuch diviſions, as one ſhall deſire. If we would have Bowers, the order therefore may be found in the <hi>60.</hi> and <hi>61.</hi> fol. If one ſhould like better Hedges or Arbours, he may find them in the fol. <hi>51.</hi> and <hi>52.</hi> If in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Bowers and Hedges, one would have a Wood, or Alleys of Trees, the <hi>112</hi> fol. will ſhew the Orders for divers ſorts. When one would make Fountains there, or ſpouts of Water, the Round of the <hi>29</hi> fol. may ſerve for a Baſon, its e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levation is at the <hi>73</hi> fol. If one would have a ſquare, he muſt take the fol <hi>19</hi> or <hi>44.</hi> For to have thereof with divers quarters he muſt ſeek in the <hi>45</hi> or <hi>46.</hi> fol. where he may find Polygones. He that would ſet Statves, or Figures vpon Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtals, which is a very fair Ornament for a Garden, he muſt take their meaſures in the fol. <hi>122.</hi> or <hi>125.</hi> If one would place there any Caves or Grottes, the <hi>74</hi> fol. will ſhew him how they ought to be made.</p>
            <p>When one oeould cauſe an Aſcent from one Garden to another, he ſhall find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſorts of ſteps in the fol. <hi>78 79 80. and 81.</hi> Every one may chooſe amongſt all theſe things, that which ſhall pleaſe him beſt, and may put them all there into the ſame piece, and without confuſion, only he muſt keep the proportions and ſymmetryes which ought to be obſerved therein.</p>
            <p>If one would have Shops open, where there is nothing but the Walls, the <hi>55</hi> fol. will ſhew: If one would that they ſhould be garniſhed with Boards or little Tables, he ſhall find the order thereof in the <hi>105</hi> fol. There is alſo another faſhion for a a Shop, which is not in the from like this, and whereof the Opening is altogether different, one may ſet it in the <hi>95.</hi> fol.</p>
            <p>Ampl theatres were heretofore more in uſe in Pictures, then they are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which is the cauſe that I have not ſet any of them here, accounting them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſeful here: If I ſhall know, that any one deſire them, I will ſet forth ſome, in the ſecond part in the mean time, if any one would raiſe up one thereof, he may uſe the plane, that is in fol <hi>29.</hi> in the which he muſt make a greater number of Circles, according to the number and bigneſs, of the Stages, that he would have therein: For to raiſe the Stages, he muſt uſe the line of elevation, which he ſhall find in the <hi>75.</hi> fol. As for Fortifications, he that would ſet them into Perſpective, ſhall find the Method to reduce and abreviate the plane thereof in the <hi>39</hi> fol. and how they ought to be elevated in fol. <hi>114.</hi>

            <p>As for all other things in particular, they are to be found according to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Table which is at the end of the Book.</p>

               <head>The Definitions, Names and Terms of the Points, Lines and Figures which we ſhall uſe.</head>
               <p>THe point hath not any parts, as we ſee A, in figure. 1. In Perſpective, there are three ſorts thereof, which are called, points of ſight, points of diſtance, and points contingent or accidental.</p>
               <p>The line, is a length without breadth, as A B in figure 2. The Perſpective hath five principle ones, the which it always uſeth. The 1. The line of the baſe or plane, as C D may be in figure 3. The 2. The line Perpendicular, or Plomb-line, which falling upon another, maketh the Angles on the one part and another equal, and theſe Angles are called Right Angles, and the line is Perpendicular to that upon the which it falleth as in the figure 3. A B and E F, falling upon C D, do make the Angle right in G. The 3. are lines parallel; Theſe are lines the wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ch being continued upon the ſame plane, and prolonged on the one part and other infinitely, will never meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as N O, in the figure 6. The Horizontal line, is no other thing, then a parallel to the baſe; We ſhall ſpeak of it more largely in its place. The 4. is the line Diagonal, this is a line drawn from one Angle to another, as K L in the figure 10. And the 5. The line occult or pointed, is a line which ought to be made in white, or with points, as O N in figure 2. and theſe lines never ought to appear, when the work is finiſhed.</p>
               <p>The right Angle, is that which we ſpeak of treating of Perpendiculars, I have ſet it apart by it ſelf, that it may be better known what it is, by E F G, in Figure 4.</p>
               <p>There are two other Angles, under which are comprized all the Angles which are not right, the one is called the Obtuſe which is more then right, as H L M, in figure 5. And the other ſharp, which is leſs then right, as is H I K, in the ſame figure.</p>
               <p>A term, is the end of any thing, as in the 2. A and B are terms or the ends of the line.</p>
               <p>A figure, is comprized by one or by more terms, as in 7. 8. 9. 13. 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are figures.</p>
               <p>The ſquare, hath the four ſides equal, and the four Angles right, A B C D, in fig. 7.</p>
               <p>The Parallelogram, or long ſquare, hath the four Angles right, but not the ſides equal as C D E F, in fig. 8.</p>
               <p>The Triangle Equilateral, hath the three ſides equal, as G H I in fig. 9.</p>
               <p>Section and Interſection of lines, are two lines which do croſs and divide themſelves in one point, as in the figure 11, the lines A B and C D, divide themſelves in E.</p>
               <p>The bowed or crooked line; is that which is drawn by a Circuit from one point to another, as L M, in fig. 12</p>
               <p>A Circle or Round, is a plane figure, comprized in one line only, called a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, towards which all the lines coming from the Center are equal between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as B C D of the figure 13, the point of the midſt of the Circle A, is called the Center</p>
               <p>The Diameter, is the right line B C of the Circle, the which paſſing by the Center of the Circle A, divideth it into two equally.</p>
               <p>The Oval is a long figure, comprized within one line only, not Circular but bowed and Regular as E in fig. 14.</p>
               <p>The Spiral or Volute, is a line, that is framed by two Centers, or by one only by Revolution or Diminution F, in fig. 15.</p>

               <p>TAngents are one or more lines, which being drawn forth, do but only touch or graze upon ſome Object, figures or lines, without dividing them in any manner, as A B touch the Circle C, at the points D D.</p>
               <p>I have placed here two ſorts of lines, which bear the ſame name with the Precedent, and which nevertheleſs produce another effect, by reaſon of the point of ſight, and of the Perſpective, for the Angle E A B ought to be held for a right Angle, and all the lines C ought to be held for Perpendiculars upon the Plane in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective, as is D F, and the lines A B, G I, and H K, are accounted Perpendiculars upon the baſe, and all the lines which go to the point of ſight, either from above or from below, or on the ſide, are called Rays, and lines viſual or Radial.</p>
               <p>The Plane or Ichnography, is a deſcription or firſt deſign, the which repreſenteth by ſingle lineaments the Prints or foot-ſteps, which the foundation of the thing which one would deſcribe, would make upon the Ground, to the end that by one view only, one may behold the correſpondence, ſcituation and interval of the parts between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as one may ſee in L and M.</p>
               <p>A Polygone is a figure which hath many Angles as is L A Degree is one little part, whereby the Circle is divided into 360, and every degree is further divided by the Aſtronomers into 60 Minutes, and theſe Minutes into 60 others which they call Seconds, &amp;c. the which is not uſeful for us here. It ſufficeth that we know, that the degrees are thoſe little diviſions which are in the Circle N O P Q, for to have the knowledge of the Angles. This knowledge will enable eaſily to make all ſorts of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygones, by dividing 360 by the number of Angles, which one would have in the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure: for example, if I would make a ſquare, I divide 360 by 4, and the Quotient will give 90, which is the right Angle N M O, and ſo of others: for thoſe which have not the uſe of Arithmetick, they ſhall finde at the fourth ſide of the Geometrical Orders to make ſuch, whatſoever may pleaſe them.</p>

               <head>Some Orders of Geometry, for to make the Lines and Figures, which we are about to define.</head>
               <p n="1">1. FOr to make the Perpendiculars, or as the Workmen ſay, the ſquare Draught, which is neceſſary in all our operations. If that you would have it in the midſt of a line, as A E, you muſt open the Compaſs more then the half of the line, and place one leg of it at the point A, and with the other frame two little Arches or Bows above and below, as F and to do the ſame from the point E, and the ſections of theſe little Arches, will give the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular upon A E, 1 figure.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the line be at the bottom of the table or paper, and that one cannot make the Arches above and below. You muſt divide this line into two, for to have the point G, then from the ends of this line to make the Arches, which ſhall divide themſelves in H, then to draw a line from H, to G, as in the ſecond figure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To elevate a Perpendicular from the end of a line, as from the point I of the line I K. This may be done divers ways, firſt as we have ſaid, but when place is wanting you muſt place one leg of the Compaſs at the point I, and with the other leg to make a great portion of the Circle L M, then to ſet the Compaſs ſo opened upon the point M, and with the other to make it to divide the Circle at the point N, then to take the half towards the point O, for to have the right Angle O I K, or without buſying ones ſelf to ſeek this half of the Arch M N, you muſt with the ſame, opening of the Compaſs make yet upon the N, and from the ſame point N, an Arch P Q, then having laid the Ruler at the points M and N, you muſt draw a line which ſhall divide this Arch P Q, at the point P, and elevate a line from I to P, for to have the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular and the right Angle P I K, figure 3.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Otherwiſe. If from the point P, you would raiſe a Perpendicular, take a point at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon the line P R, as Q, and from the point Q make a Circle which toucheth the point P, and ſhall divide the line P S, in ſome part, as S, then to draw from S, by the point Q, unto the circumference of the Circle T, and T P, ſhall be the Perpendicular. fig 4. For to abre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate all the orders, you muſt have an equaller very juſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5. From a point given upon a line to make a Perpendicular to fall From the point given A; you muſt make the Arch B C, which divideth the line given E F, at the points G H, from theſe points G H, make two little Arches above and below, which ſhall divide themſelves as at the point I, then from the point A, cauſe a line to fall paſſing by I, upon the line E F, and that ſhall be the Perpendicular of the point given.</p>
               <p n="6">6. From a point given at the end of a line to make a Perpendicular fall. Let the point given be K, and the line L M, from the point K, you muſt draw a line traverſing at pleaſure, which divideth in ſome place the line L M, as N: after divide this line K N, into two equal parts, and from the midſt O, make the Arch that paſſeth by the point K, and at the ſection which it will make upon the line L M, as P, and the point P, ſhall be to make the Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to fall K P.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The parallels. For to be well made ought to be over half-Rounds, which they ought to touch as F G, which is parallel to H I, it is made over the half, Round which it toucheth at the points K L.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To divide a line into many equal parts. Let the line to be divided be A B. You muſt draw another above or below, which may be parallel to it, as C D, and upon this latter, which muſt be greater or leſſer, then that which is to be divided: You muſt make as many parts, as you would divide that of A B into, as in our example ſeven, then from the firſt and laſt point of theſe diviſions, to draw lines which paſs by the ends of that which is to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, which ſhall divide themſelves in a certain point as here, having drawn from C by A, and from D, by B, the ſection E is made, at which point F, you muſt draw all the diviſions of the line C D, and the line A B, ſhall be divided as one deſireth.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

               <p>The end of Perſpective is to repreſent upon a Plane, as is E F G H, the objects which are beyond ſuch as you ſee here A B C D, repreſented in I K L M: for to underſtand this better, let us ſuppoſe that there is upon the Ground an object A B C D, and that the Eye of the Beholder is in O, if one put between the one and the other a tranſparent Body, marked with E F G H, the Sections which the Rayes of the Eye would make of the Perpendicular Q R S T, would make the Figure I K L M, ſuch as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject would appear in the tranſparent Body: which maketh us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that all Perſpective is no other thing, then ſections of a line: This is the reaſon that Monſieur <hi>Marolois,</hi> calleth always that which he putteth in Perſpective; The Appearance of the Section, becauſe that the Plane E F G H, divideth the viſual Pyramid A B C D and O, and giveth for the Section I K L M.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of theſe Sections is, that one only line can determine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, &amp; that it is neceſſary, that there be two of them which divide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs for to have a Point: ſeeing that it is certain, that from our eye to the object there is always made a Radius or right line, this cannot fail us: but for to have another, which muſt divide it, we muſt imagine, that from our foot there is made a Center, from whence divers Lines or Rayes do proceed which go to the Angles of the objects, which we behold as from the Center P to the Angles A B C D, the which Rayes being divided by ſome tranſparent Plane, as is E F G H, all theſe Rays P B, P A, P C, P D, which were Horizontal, raiſe themſelves, and become Perpendiculars, as P B, becometh Q M, P D, becometh R L, &amp;c.

               <p>THis Figure will help to ſatisfie this queſtion, which is difficult e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; let us ſuppoſe then, that ſome body hath his eye † at the midſt of a line: it is evident, that if he would ſee the two Ends thereof A B, he muſt make an half-round V X, the center of which is the Eye, and the centrical Ray † †, and making this half-Circle, he diſcovereth the objects, which are on the one ſide and other in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that it ſeemeth to him. that the fartheſt diſtant of the ſide A, ſeem to come near to the center †. And thoſe on the ſide B go thither alſo, and ſeem as if they would joyn themſelvs, as much as the one and the other ſide can.</p>
               <p>If one ask why the things ſo diſtant, approach the one to the other, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be of the ſide either above or below us: for it ſeemeth, that that which is on our ſides would joyn themſelves, and that the planchers both above and below, do raiſe up and abaſe themſelves the farther they are diſtant from us.</p>
               <p>Behold the Anſwer and the Reaſon in two words: It is that all the objects appear, under the viſual Angle, under the which they are ſeen: now it is that the columns, trees, or whatſoever objects they be, which are on the ſide A, the fartheſt diſtant will appear to draw towards the center T, becauſe they are viewed by an Angle, or by a Radius that draweth thitherward; and as for example, the Ray † K, is much nearer the centrical T, then is † C, and † E, and by conſequent it ought to appear ſo: and if the the objects were produced infinitely, they would ſtill approach nearer to the centrical T, until that they would ſeem to make but one point, which would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, as all the points of ſight ought to be.</p>
               <p>Now in Perſpective the ſides A K, B S, remain not Parallels, but are changed into viſual Rayes, which divide themſelves at the point of ſight, and by this means cauſe the Diminutions of the body and ſides of the objects. For example in the ſecond Figure, the eye being in a diſtance capable of ſeeing the line A B, from the two Angles A B, two Rayes begin to be made, which go to finde out the point of ſight T. And theſe Rayes A T and B T, receive the ſections that the point of diſtance giveth to objects, which do cloſe together proportionally, as we ſhall declare in its place, ſo that the whole Parallellogramne A K, B S, and all the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that are on the one part and the other, come to be reduced to the little ſpace A V, B X: and if the eye were farther diſtant, this ſpace would be yet leſſer, by reaſon that the objects, view'd afar off, ſeem very ſmall, as I ſhall make it appear in the next leaf.</p>

               <head>Wherefore the Objects draw near to each other, being view'd afar off.</head>
               <p>WE have already ſaid, that things do appear according to the Angle, in the which they are view'd; this Angle is taken at the Eye, where the lines do meet that do compute the Object: for example, the firſt Object being B C, if the Eye A look upon it, it will cauſe the Rayes A B and A C, which give the Angle B A C: ſo that an Object ſeen in a great Angle will appear great, and another ſeen in a little Angle will appear little: Now it is, that the Objects being equal, thoſe that are fartheſt off are view'd in a leſs Angle: we muſt conclude then, that the Objects fartheſt off, ought to be the leaſt in Perſpectives: for example, if the Eye be in A the Object B C, which is the firſt, will appear to it the greateſt, becauſe that it is viewed by a greater Angle, the 2 3 4 and 5 Objects, will appear to it always the leſs, although that they be equal: the reaſon is, becauſe that the Angles diminiſh; according as the Objects are farther diſtant if the Eye were remitted into N L K L, it would appear the greateſt, and B C would be no bigger then N O.</p>
               <p>This ſecond figure is in purſuit of that which we are ſpeaking of: for ſuppoſing, that the Objects appear ſuch, as is the Angle within which they are viewed; it followeth thence, that if one draw many lines under one and the ſame Triangle, that they ought to appear equal amongſt themſelves: ſo we ſay, that all the lines which are compriſed between the lines of the Triangle N O P, will appear equal amongſt themſelves. Now ſeeing that all the Objects compriſed by the ſame Angle ſeem equal, thoſe which ſhall be compriſed by a greater Angle will ſeem greater, and thoſe that ſhall be compriſed by a leſs Angle will ſeem leſs.</p>
               <p>Suppoſing that which we have ſaid, if there were a quantity of Columns or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſters of one ſide and the other in an Hall, it would be of neceſſity that the Objects ſhould be under the ſame Angle, and that all ſhould proceed unto one point, which is within the Horizon O. For example, the Eye being in A, diſcovering the firſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject D E if from the points D E, one draw the viſual Rayes, D O, E O, they will make the Triangle D O E, which will encloſe the Pilaſters D E, F G, H I, K L, M N, whence they ought to appear all equal.</p>
               <p>That which we have ſaid concerning the ſides, ought to be underſtood likewiſe of the pavements and planchers: for the diminutions of the Angles, under the which we ſee the Objects that are far off, are made as well both above and under us as on the ſides. Wherefore we ſhall ſay thereof no other thing, but only that we muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that there be as many ſquares between the Objects fartheſt off, as between thoſe that are nearer: for although that the Objects which are remoteſt do cloſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the more far they are off: yet they ceaſe not to keep their ſaid diſtance, as we may ſee between B C D E, which is the Interval of the Pilaſters, there are ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſquares.

Others will not have this ſecond Horizon, and uſe always the Natural, in what place ſoever the Picture be placed, imagining that all the height and bredth which they have before them is as a great Piece or Picture, of which that which is elevated in effect ought to take its Meaſures: The honour that <hi>I</hi> bear to the one and the other, ſuffereth me not to determine upon it, ſeeing that many good Authors have ſuffered them both. But if any one ſhould preſs me to ſpeak my opinion, I would ſay freely that I am of the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the latter, by reaſon that all that is in the Picture would appear there more natural.</p>
               <p>This line beareth always the Points of ſight, of diſtance, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Contingents or Accidental: in brief, this is that which ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth the Heaven from the Earth, and which limiteth the ſight: it is always Parallel to the bottom of the Picture or Plane, upon the which the Object is placed: whence it appeareth, that one cannot ſet any thing above the Horizon, which ſurpaſſeth not the height of the Eye. But if the Object be ſo high, that it paſſeth this Horizon, it muſt be then, that the Plane of the ſame Object be above: as for example, a Tree or a Mountain may well have its Top above the Horizon; but nevertheleſs the foot thereof is far on this ſide.</p>
               <p>All that is below the Horizon, maketh its upper part appear, and as ſoon as one is paſt it, one can ſee it no more. For example, the two Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces placed upon the foundation of the firſt figure A B ſhew their Top, becauſe that the Horizon is above that of the ſecond figure D C, do not ſhew it: and if they be as it were in the ſame line, by greater reaſon, thoſe of the third E F ought leſs to ſhew it, ſeeing that they exceed it very much: they are nevertheleſs as high the one as the other, it is then the Horizon that cauſeth this difference.</p>

               <p>THIS is a general Maxime, That all the lines which are Perpendicular to the baſe, within a Geometral Plane, ought always to be drawn at the point of ſight, when one would ſet the ſame Planes in Perſpective; for example, in the little Plane of the firſt figure the baſe is A B, upon which all the lines Z are Perpendicular to it.</p>
               <p>This being ſuppoſed, that if one give a leſs or a greater line then that of the Plane, as the great line A B, which hath the ſame number of diviſions with the little one, and from all theſe diviſions Z, one draw to the point of ſight all theſe lines of Z to E, they will all be perpendicular to the baſe, according to the Reaſons of Perſpective, we may alſo name them Radial, and properly viſual Rayes: the laſt of which are called Extremes, by reaſon that they are at the end of the baſe, as are theſe A B.</p>

               <head>Of the Diagonals or Diametrals, and of their ſections.</head>
               <p>IT is alſo a Maxime, that all the Diagonals of ſquares in Perſpective, are drawn at the Point of diſtance. For example, at the little Plane of the ſecond Figure, the Diagonals D O, F O, are drawn at the points of diſtances in the Plane in Perſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, the which maketh that the points of diſtances do give us the Abridgements of the Objects, that the point of ſight doth remove from us: in ſuch manner (as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid) that if one draw from the ends of the line of the baſe F G to the points of diſtances L M, they ſhall be Diagonals; and where the lines ſhall divide the outmoſt Rayes F K and G K, at the points O; this ſhall be the Abridgment of the ſquare, whereof F G is one ſide: and where the ſame lines ſhall divide the lines Z at the point Q, one muſt draw Parallels which ſhall give the Abridgement of all the ſquares, and a like number of all the ſides, as in the little Plane. And the more theſe points of diſtances are removed from the point of ſight, the more the Objects do abridge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and cloſe together. And this is it, why all the Beauty of the Perſpective depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on the points of diſtances, which ought neither to be too near, nor too far off from the point of ſight: the which made me ſet this third figure, with diverſity of removals, for to cauſe a belief of the verity of that which I am ſpeaking. Let us ſuppoſe then that R is the point of ſight, and S S the outmoſt Rays; if one ſets the point of diſtance at T, he ſhall divide the Radius S R, at the point V, which ſhall be the abridgement of the ſquare, whereof S S is one ſide, the which is ridiculous to ſee a ſquare which ſhould appear three times more hollow then it ought to be, by reaſon that the point of the diſtance T is too near to the point of the ſight R, for it muſt be at the neareſt, that the point of diſtance be as far removed from the point of ſight, as the half of the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, or of the Perſpective, which one would have ſeen, as is X, removed from R, by reaſon that theſe Removals do always give a right Angle to the Eye of the Beholder. In V it would be more pleaſing, dividing the ſquare at 2, and at 3, it would be better, dividing it at 4. At 5 it would be far enough removed, and would make the ſquare more ſhort in 6, as we ſhall give the reaſon in the figure following.</p>
               <p>Some one may ſay to me, why have I then ſet in all the Figures of this Book, the points of diſtances ſo near, ſeeing that being removed farther, the whole would have been more pleaſing: And he might by reaſon, if I had made the book only to have bin ſeen for curioſity: but it being made for to teach, there was need that all ſhould be ſeen, the better to underſtand our Orders: this is the cauſe, that I have put into the works as much as I could. If one anſwer me, that it were better to make the book longer: I muſt then have made it much bigger, and have ſet but one figure in every page: the which I would avoid and make a book, convenient for carriage and it will ſuffice to advertiſe that amongſt the works that one ſhall make, he ought to enlarge them: the which is eaſie, keeping the Rules which we have given.</p>

               <p>WE have ſaid, ſpeakingf of far off viſual Rayes, that the Eye could not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently diſcover more, then that which may be compriſed within one right viſual Angle. That is to ſay, that the ſight receiveth not clearly nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely the Objects, when the Rayes go beyond the right Angle: And behold the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, The apple of the eye being near to the center of the eye, cannot receive clearly more then a quarter of a circle, ſo that the Rayes which are beyond that have but a confuſed and troubled ſight, when the Angle is more then 90 degrees: this is the cauſe that it is better to make it rather leſſer then greater, as it may be of two thirds, which are 60 degrees, but not leſs: becauſe that the Rayes being ſo ſtreightned or reſtrained, would not give Contentment to the Eye, becauſe that the Angles being ſo little, make as it were but one point between the Apple of the Eye: let us ſee this difference by fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures. Suppoſing that theſe Planes and theſe Squares were the ſame that are in the laſt figure. The diſtance of the point T to R, will give us the diſtance of T to the Baſe, where being, it would be neceſſary that the Angle open it ſelf much more; for to ſee the Extremes Y, Y: for if it open but as a right Angle, the Eye ſhall not be able to ſee all, as T the right Angle, cannot ſee but the points V, V, the which would make the Perſpective wholly faulty, by reaſon that that which ſhould give us a ſquare, would frame us a Parallelogramme. The neareſt that one can ſet it is at the point X, which is, as I ſaid even now, the true Meaſure of the right Angle, which containeth all the Piece Y, Y: If one withdraw it yet further from the point of ſight, it will be yet more pleaſing, as in I, which hath but an Angle of 72 degrees. But if one withdraw it unto Z it will be the perfection, becauſe that the Rayes being not ſo much dilated, have the more force, and conteine better the Objects: but I would never goe any farther then 5. for the reaſon whereof we are ſpeaking; that the Angles are but as one point within the Eye, and a confuſion within the Object. The which ought to oblige us to take good heed, where we ſet the Points, ſeeing that they are ſo important and neceſſary. And to hold for a general Maxime, that it muſt be at leaſt, that the diſtance be equall to the ſpace, which is from the right Radius, unto the Corner of Perſpective. For xample <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> R, is the right Radius and X <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>, the leſſer diſtance which is equall to <g ref="char:cross">✚</g> Y, whereof having taken the Meaſure, we muſt Carry it on the one and other ſide of the Point ſight as here R S S. Or of one ſide onely, as ſhall be ſeen in the Leaf following.</p>
               <p>Behold what may be ſaid herein, by the reaſons of the Eye, but the Practice giveth this Excellent Rule, which may be Generall, ſo that one uſe it with diſeretion. That having choſen the place, where you would make the Perſpective, you may determine on what ſide it will be the better in ſight, and whence it ought to be looked on: and then you muſt take the meaſure of this laſt place unto the former, and ſet this Interval by a little ſcale from the point of ſight unto the point of diſtance: provided that it be not too far removed: and it is in this, that the diſcretion is requiſite, that one do not ſet it too near, and to avoid that which we are ſpeaking of, nor too far off, for fear that we finde no returns where one would have it ſet: for Objects ſo far removed from the ſight do yield no return. This is why we ought to give but the draught to Buildings far diſtant, as we ſhall ſay hereafter.</p>

Let the Point of ſight be in C, and the point of diſtance in D, from which if you draw the line A D, you ſhall have the ſections Q, which give the abridgement of the ſquares in the ſame Number with the other. The reſt ſhalbe known in the Orders following.</p>

               <p>ONe may ſink or hollow the Perſpectives, aſmuch as one would, by the Means of the Baſe E F, if one draw lines to the points of diſtances H I; for which they ſhall divide the Viſuals E G and F G at the point K, it ſhall be the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgement of the firſt ſquare, as we have already ſaid twice or thrice. Now if we take his line K K for the baſe, and from the ends K K, we draw lines to the points of the diſtances, where they ſhall divide the ſame line E G and F G at the point L L, that ſhall be the Abridgment of the ſecond ſquare, which ſhall have as many diviſions and ſquares as the former; if we ſhall take further this line L L, and ſhall make the ſame Operations, we ſhall have the Abridgment of the third ſquare at the point M. And if we ſhall begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain further by that, we ſhall have a fourth, and ſo we ſhall go unto a Point: the which would be a length which would appear infinite; And by this means it is eaſie to ſink and to abridge the Perſpectives: for if you would have the double of its bredth, do as we tell you; if you would have but the half, draw a line where the lines of the points of the diſtances croſs themſelves, as in N, and you ſhall have that which you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
               <p>Seeing that this is ſo infallible, that as many viſual Rayes as divide the Diagonal line drawn from the points at the diſtances to the baſe, ſo many ſquares one hath of ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: we may, as I ſaid, give as many hollowings as we would to the Perſpective; for if in ſtead of taking from the point of diſtance O, at the Ray F, you draw it from the Ray Q. There will want two ſquares, but that you have abridged the whole ſquare R, as we ſee in S, which is that which you have fail'd to take of the whole ſquare. And if beſides the ſquare, you would have yet two little ſquares, make a line from the ſame point O, which divideth two Rays as V, you ſhall have that which you deſire. If you would have four, take X: if ſix N. If the ſquare whole Z, the which is a great eaſineſs, when one underſtands it well.</p>

               <p>THE Baſe only may ſerve for to give ſuch a ſinking as one would have and in what place they would, without uſing any little ſquares, this is a means very ready, but it is ſomewhat hard to underſtand; Nevertheleſs I will endeavour to make it be underſtood, the beſt that I ſhall be able, for we do often uſe it. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, let the Baſe be B S, the point of ſight A, the points of diſtances D E: If you would make the Plane of a Cube B C, you muſt draw to the points of ſight two Occult lines, or pointed from the ends B C, then for to give it its bredth take the ſame meaſure B C, which you ſhall tranſport upon the Baſe C F, equal to B C, from which point you ſhall draw a line to the point of diſtance D, and where this line ſhall divide the firſt Ray C at the point G, this ſhallbe the Abridgement of the plane of the Cube B H G C.</p>
               <p>If you would have an Object more forward towards the midſt, you muſt take the bredth of it and the diſtance above the Baſe, as I K. Now for to have the ſinking, ſet ſuch as you would have upon the ſame Baſe, as it might be L M, becauſe that it is broad at that point L, and aſmuch for the largenes at the point M. Then from theſe Points L M, draw an occult line to the point of diſtance D, and where theſe lines ſhall divide the Raye K, at the points N O, you muſt draw Parallels to the Baſe and you ſhall have the ſquare Q P O N.</p>
               <p>By this manner, you may tranſport on the other ſide the ſquare, which would be above the Baſe, as B H G C, is tranſported to V, and the Points M and T, which are removed but 2 feet from the point S, do give a figure very narrow, becauſe that they are very near, and the ſame diſtance, which they are removed, as we ſee X.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>The fourth Advice of the Baſe and of one only point of diſtance.</head>
               <p>SEeing that one may have the bredths and the depths, by the means of this Baſe, one ſhall neede no more to take the Paines to make the little ſquares, the which I would make appear to the ſight in this example. Let us ſuppoſe, that you would make a Ranke of Pillars, or Trees on each ſide: You muſt ſet upon the Baſe the place and diſtance that you would have, with their bredth or Diameter, as A B C D E F G. Then placing the Rule upon the point of the diſtance O, unto each of theſe Points A B C D E F G, where it ſhall marke the ſections upon the viſuall Raye A H, it ſhallbe the Termes of the Objects which you deſire. For to tranſport them on the other ſide, upon the Raye G H, Set one leg of the Compaſs at the Ocular Point H, and with the other take the ſame without ſtirring the leg from the Point H, make an Arch with the other, where it ſhall divide the Raye G H, this ſhall be the ſame Terme; as M is the ſame with N. And ſo of others, by the which you ſhall draw Parallells, which will give you the bredths. And for the length, give it ſuch, as you would have it, and ſet it from A, as it might be P, then draw from the point P, to the point H, and where it ſhall divide the other Parallells, it ſhall be the Planes that you deſire, which you may make rounds or ſquares.</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>The fifth Advice, not to deceive ones ſelf in the Meaſures.</head>
               <p>YOU muſt never ſet on the ſide of the point of diſtance where one would draw for to give the ſinking, the Objects which one deſireth to produce within the Plane. Example, The viſuall Ray, upon the which one muſt mark, let it be A B: If you would produce there the point C, and D, it cannot be drawn from the point of diſtance E, but well from that which is oppoſite to it F. If C and D, were within, as G H, it ought to be drawn from the point E: becauſe that the line of the ſection meeteth between both, and not from the point E: and ſo both the one, and the other ſhall divide themſelves in the ſame point I K.</p>

               <head>The ſixth Advice, of the Point of diſtance only.</head>
               <p>SOmetimes one is at ſuch a ſtreight for the ſmalneſs of the place that one hath, be it againſt a wall, or cloth, or paper; that it is impoſſible to make more then one point of diſtance, and then thoſe that are always accuſtomed to have two of them are much troubled: We muſt draw them, and cauſe them to underſtand, that one Point only ſufficeth for this Practice. Let us ſuppoſe that we would make a Pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſmall ſquares, and that we have already drawn all the viſual Rays ar the point A, for to have the Abridgement thereof, we ought to draw at the points of diſtances, and the ſections will give us the points where we ought to draw, as we have already ſaid: but if there be but one as B, we muſt draw this one draught Diagonal C B, which will divide all the viſual Rays. Now for to mark the ſame ſections upon the Rays oppoſite, for to draw Parallels there: We muſt, as I ſaid but now; ſet a leg of the Compaſs at the point A, and with the other to run through all the ſections, as I P: But this is not good, but only for that which is viewed in front: Whence there is need of one, which ſerveth likewiſe for that of the ſide: behold it here, Take a Compaſs, and ſet one leg upon the baſe, with the other; take the moſt perpendicularly that you ſhall be able, the ſection that you deſire to tranſport as D, and carry it upon this line Perpendicular, as E O, and mark your meaſure F, then draw from D to F, and you ſhall have the ſame as if there were two points of diſtances: And ſo of all other ſections.</p>

               <p>WHEN one would uſe the outmoſt Ray for the line or ſection, as it might be G H; He ought to ſet the Objects upon the baſe, as are K L M N O, and from thence to draw them to the point of diſtance L, which ought to be drawn back as far as ſhall be poſſible, to the end that the Abridgement of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective, may be the more pleaſing thereby: for if the point were nearer to the point of ſight G, the Objects would have too much hollowneſs, (I mean, for example, that a ſquare would appear a Parallelogram) And from this point I, to run through all the Objects K L M N O, and to mark the ſection of the Ray G H: And from theſe points to draw Parallels to the baſe, or of the Horizon, as is here P Q. This Method is the leaſt in uſe, although ſome do take it.</p>

Then for to draw the Parallels, he hath only to tranſport this line X or T, upon the foot of the other Ray as is V, and from all theſe points to draw lines Parallels to the baſe, and you ſhall have that which you deſire.</p>

But as there is no Rule ſo general, which hath not its exception; ſo there are certain Figures, which one cannot ſet into Perſpective, but by the help of theſe Planes: further alſo one ſhould be troubled, if one ſhould give one of theſe Planes to be ſet into Perſpective, and that one had not learned how he ought to pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">1. To contract or abridge a ſquare A B C D. One muſt draw A B at the point of ſight E, and from the ſame Angles A B, two Diagonals, F B, A G, and where they ſhall divide the Rays A E and B E, at the points H and I. This ſhall be the ſquare A B C D, abridged into A H I B; for to make it without the Geometrical Plane, we muſt draw from B to F, or from A to G, or elſe tranſport A B upon the baſe, as B K, and from the point K to draw to the point F, it will give the ſame ſection I upon the Ray B E.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To abridge a ſquare viewed by the Angle D, having made the Plane A B C D. We muſt draw a line which toucheth the Angle B, and it muſt be in right Angle upon the line B D. This baſe being produced, we muſt ſet the Rule upon the ſides of the ſquare, as A D, and D C, and where this Rule ſhall divide the baſe, there to make the points H I, then to draw H and B, to the points of diſtances P and B I, to the other point of diſtance G. And at the ſection of theſe lines to make the points which ſhall give you the ſquare K L M B; for to make it without the Plane, you muſt ſet the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ameter on the one part, and the other of the middle B, as H and I. But as well in the one manner as the other, you muſt not draw at the point of ſight O.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To abridge a Circle. It muſt be encloſed in a ſquare A B C D: And from the Angles A D and G B, to draw Diagonals, which ſhall divide the Circle into eight parts; and where they ſhall divide it at the point O, to draw upon the baſe the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiculars E F, then to draw two lines Diametral Q R S P, which divide themſelves in right Angles at the Center G. The Plane being ordered in this manner, you muſt draw all the Perpendiculars at the point of ſight H, and where they are divided, the Diagonals A K, and B I, to make points; of the which the two latter M N, are the draughts of the ſquare, which are to be divided into four by the ſection of the Diagonals, at the point P. Then from the ends of this Croſs they draw bended lines by theſe points, which give the ſhape of a Circle in Perſpective. This manner may paſs for little ones: but we ſhall give one more exact for the greater.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This Figure is compoſed of the two firſt, wherefore I will ſay nothing of it; for he that ſhall have made one or two of them, ſhall be able to make it eaſily.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The fifth depends alſo upon the two firſt: but there is alſo more a Border round about, which they have not; for to ſet this Border into Perſpective, we muſt draw theſe four Rays A B C D, at the point of ſight G, and where the inward Rays B and C are divided by the Diagonals A F and D E, we muſt draw Parallels to the baſe, and you ſhall have that which you demand.</p>

               <head>Of a Triangle.</head>
               <p>THE Triangles, according to the Numbers, ought to precede the ſquares: but according to reaſon, they ought to go after in this work, becauſe they are harder to ſet into Perſpective, not becauſe of the Plane, which is eaſie enough, ſeeing that it is compoſed and framed of 3 equal lines joyn'd together; but becauſe of the obliquity of its ſides.</p>
               <p>Let us now ſee the Practice of the Advice that we have given of Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures upon the baſe A B, for to make this Triangle in Perſpective, we muſt from all theſe Angles 1, 2, and 3, draw Perpendiculars upon A B, and ſet one leg of the Compaſs in their ſection, and with the other take the Removal of the Object from the baſe, and ſet alſo this Removal upon the ſame baſe, by making a quarter of a Round, as 1, 1, and 1, the ſame at 2, 2, and 2, and the ſame at 3, 3, and 3. Then having made another baſe in another place, as is this here under E F, we muſt tranſport there the Meaſures, which are upon that A B, and draw at the point of ſight C, the points 1, 2, and 3, Perpendiculars. Then having taken a point of diſtance D, there to draw the other points of ſinking 1, 2, and 3: and at the ſection of the viſual Rays: by this we muſt produce the lines, which ſhall give you the Triangle.</p>
               <p>If you would give to it this Border, you need but do the ſame again, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating that which we are doing, ſetting down other cyphers, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be confounded, as over againſt 1, 4, and 2 <hi>a</hi> 5. and to 3 <hi>a</hi> 6. Then draw the Perpendiculars at the point C, and where the others ſhall divide them, there to draw the lines as you ſee.</p>
               <p>The Triangle equilateral, as this is circular; that is to ſay, which they encloſe within a circle, whereof each ſide hath 120 degrees.</p>
               <p>There is no need to know the degrees of the Angles, for to frame all theſe Polygones, ſo as we may ſee at the 4. ſide: but I have not omitted to ſet them for the contentment of thoſe which here take notice of them.</p>

Now for to ſet it in Perſpective, it is altogether the ſame thing with the Triangles, as one may ſee by this figure, except that it is with a Border; and I have marked it upon the baſe: but ſingle, by reaſon that one may have learned by the Triangle, how it ought to be made.

As a divideth the Ray marked 2, which giveth the ſecond Angle, 4 giveth the fourth Angle, and ſo of others. All the reſt is clear enough, we muſt take heed of one thing, which is, that all the Angles ought to draw to the center 6.

               <p>THE Hexagone is a Plane which hath ſix Angles, and ſix faces or ſides. It is the eaſieſt of all the Poligones, that is to ſay, of all the figures of many ſides: for the ſame opening of the Compaſs wherewith theſe uſe to make the circle, which is its half Diameter; giveth the ſides of the Hexagone of 60 degrees for each ſide. As for the ſetting of it into Perſpective, there is no difference in it from the Triangle and the Pentagone, as well for the ſingle Plane as with the Border or Thickneſs. A is the point of ſight, B that of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>Seeing that we have more ſpace in this leaf then in others; we will give a ſmall Practiſe of ſetting into Perſpective the Borders or Thickneſſes of any Poligones that may be, whether regular or irregular: Let us uſe this Hexagone; for to give an example of our Propoſition, ſuppoſing that the Plane of the front of the third Figure hath but a ſingle draught; and that it ſhould have a Thickneſs or Border, which turneth round about it; for to ſet it into Perſpective, you muſt lay the Rule the length of the ſides of the ſingle draught, and make a point upon the Horizon, where it ſhall be divided, as laying the Rule along the ſide A B, it will divide the Horizon at the point C; then laying it again upon the Plane B D, it will give the point E, and likewiſe of all the other ſides. Before that you do any more, you muſt from all theſe Angles draw lines, which paſs by the center F, and theſe lines which ought to be occult, ſhall ſerve for to receive the ſections which give the diminution. All theſe Orderings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, you muſt ſet the bredth or largeneſs if you would give to the Border or Liſt upon the baſe as A H; and draw this firſt bredth at the point of diſtance G; and where this line G H, ſhall divide I, it ſhallbe the Terme or bound of the thickneſs of the firſt ſide: and which ſhall give it to all the others. For from this point, you muſt draw to the point of the ſide C, and at the ſection of the line K, it ſhallbe the diminution, from the which drawing to the point of the ſide B D, which is E, you ſhall have the other diminution at the point L, which ſhall ſerve for the laſt ſide L M.

               <p>THe more that any Circular forme ſhall have parts, the ſooner and more eaſily ſhall it be converted into a Round: hence it is, that <hi>Serlio</hi> ſaith, that we muſt frame a Demi-Circle, and of this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, one may make as many equal Parts as they would: for the more that it ſhall have of them, the more this Rotundity will be perfect: for example, the Demi-circle, a Plomb or Down-right is divided into eight Parts, which will give ſixteen for the whole Round: and from theſe diviſions Z, to elevate Lines Perpendicular, upon the baſe, at the point E. Then we muſt draw two Diagonals at the points of Diſtances, which are here farther removed then the Plate is broad; but which one ought to ſuppoſe within the horizon ordinarily; which will give a ſquare A H I B; now the ſquare being framed, we muſt draw all the points E, at the point of ſight F, unto the line H I, and at the ſections of theſe lines to draw Parallels throughout. Then we muſt begin at the midſt of one of the ſides of the ſquare, to make a point, as <hi>a,</hi> &amp; another point at the Angle oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, as if one would draw a Diagonal, as <hi>b,</hi> continuing ſo to do from points of Angles to Angles, following the Diagonal lines, as <hi>a b c d E f g h i K l m n o p q.</hi> Theſe points will frame a perfect Rotundity: then you muſt bring with the hand bended lines, or circular, and you ſhall have your round in Perſpective.

Then having ſet on the one ſide and other, or in the midſt of the line of the ſection B C, draw Parallels to the baſe, by all theſe diviſions, unto the outmoſt Ray D A, E A; you muſt ſet the bredth of the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſters D K, upon the baſe, and draw a line at the point of ſight A, and the ſection of the lines Parallels by theſe K A, ſhall be the bredth of the Pilaſters.</p>

               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:59268:53"/>
               <head>Some Neceſſary Advice, for the Orders following.</head>
               <p>IT ſeemeth to me that I have given ſufficiently to underſtand that which belongeth to the Ichnography, and Planigraphy, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Planes, which is neceſſary for the foundation of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thography and Scenography. The Orthography is the face, or fore-part &amp;c. As one may ſee in the Definitions. Scenography, is the Elevation of all that which any one hath a deſigne to make &amp;c. See the Definitions which are at the beginning of this Book.</p>
               <p>For to make this more clear to thoſe that are not acquainted with theſe words; we ſhall Name hereafter (as I ſaid already in the Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) the Ichnography, the Plane, and the Orthography, and Sceno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy, by a Word common to the one and the other, the Elevation: So that, inſtead of ſaying the Orthography, we ſhall ſay the Elevation of the fore-part; And for Scenography, the Elevation of the whole.</p>
               <p>Before we paſs any further it muſt be obſerved, that the Elevations do never give to the eye all the Angles of the Plane, and the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of faces depend on the Aſpect, which cauſeth the object to be ſeen: for if it be ſeen on the front as the figure A, it will ſhew but one face, although that the Plane have four; If it be view'd from the Angle, although on the front it will ſhew two, as B, and never more, with what Aſpect ſoever one look on it. This ought to be underſtood of a ſquare, ſeeing that figures with divers Panes, may give thereof 3 4 5 and more. Now it is, that if the objects decline a little from the point of ſight, they are ſeen from the Angle, whence they ought to ſhew two faces; And the further they are removed from the point of ſight, the more they are diſcovered. As K E are more diſcovered then C L, although their thickneſs be equal.</p>
               <p>Another thing alſo that is further to be marked is, That which is Parallel to the Horizon, when the object is view'd in front, although in Perſpective, as C D E F from the Gate in the firſt figure, becometh a viſual Ray; when the ſame object is view'd being in a Return, or obliquely. As in the ſecond figure, that C D E F, which is in the front above, is made a viſual Ray to that which is under: And on the contrary, that which is a Ray to that above, is made a Parallel to the baſe to that below, as D G F H L. The Perpendiculars are always Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiculars.</p>

               <head>Of the Line of Elevation for to give the Heights to all kinde of Bodies and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and in ſuch a Place as one would within a Plane.</head>
               <p>WE muſt endeavor to underſtand well, and remember this Rule: which is of ſuch importance, that he that ſhall know it perfectly, will not be troubled in the Elevations, whatſoever they be of.</p>
               <p>As for to make the Planes, we have uſed the baſe for the Elevations: we ought alſo to uſe a line which ſhall direct us, and ſhall bring the Meaſures of the Heights that are needful to every thing which one would elevate.</p>
               <p>This line of Elevation muſt be Perpendicular upon the baſe A B, which is always the neareſt to our ſight, and the firſt of the Plane: By conſequence, capable of giving and bearing the Meaſures of all that one would make in the Picture, and therefore the line of Elevation C D is placed upon the line A B Perpendicularly, as all thoſe muſt be upon the Plane which we ſhall uſe henceforward. We muſt then remember, that when we ſhall ſpeak of Perpendicules, or Perpendicks, in the reſt of our Orders, we muſt always underſtand of Plumb-lines upon the Plane or baſe.</p>
               <p>Seeing that this line of Elevation muſt receive and give the Heights to all the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that one would elevate from a Plane: it muſt have the ſame Horizon with the Plane. Therefore we muſt from the foot of this line, which one may ſet on the left or right ſide, draw within the Horizon, as one would have it, that is to ſay, that it is no great matter where the Point be ſet within the Horizon: for in what place ſoever it be, it will always give the ſame effect, as it is from the foot of the line C to the point E, one may ſet it at the point of ſight, if one will. I have ſet this line on the one ſide and other in the firſt Figure, and their point different within the Horizon, for to give to underſtand that it is well throughout.</p>
               <p>If from the point H, which is in the Plane of the ſecond Figure, you would elevate a line of two foot high; you muſt ſet upon the line of Elevation two equal Parts, which you ſhall make to ſerve each for a foot, beginning at the point C, as are C F, which is two foot high, to draw to the point E, and you ſhall have an Elevation of two feet, between the two lines C and F, drawn to the point E.</p>
               <p>For to give the height of two feet to a line elevated from the point H: you muſt from the point H. draw a Parallel occult to the baſe, until that it divide the line below C E, which ſhall be the point I. If from the point I one elevate a Perpendicule I K, between C F, it ſhall be the height that it ought for the line of the point H, which you muſt take with a Compaſs and carry it to the point H, which will give H L of two feet high.</p>
               <p>If from the point M, you would have one of the ſame height of two feet, you muſt make the ſame Operation, and you ſhall have between C F the Perpendicule N O, which ſhall be the height that it ought at the point M. And making the ſame Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the point P, you ſhall have the Perpendicule Q R, for the height of the line of the point P.</p>
               <p>For to give them the height of 3, 4, 5, 10, 20 and 30 feet. It is always the ſame Order; there is nothing but to ſet theſe diſtances and heights aboveſaid upon the line of the Elevation. And from the point of the height, that you would give to draw to the point of the line within the Horizon, which is here the point E, and to make all the ſame Operations, which we are about making: and you ſhall have that which you deſire.</p>

               <head>The Elevation of a Cube in Perſpective.</head>
               <p>HAving made the Plane by the Orders foregoing, and having ſet the line of Elevation upon any ſide of the Plane, as is F L upon the baſe; We muſt ſet upon this line F L, the height of a Cube, which is a Figure ſquare on all the ſides, as a Dy, which ſhall be F M, from which points F M we muſt draw to the point of the line of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation E. Then from all the Angles of the Plane A B C D, to bring Parallels to the baſe, until that they meet with the line F E, which is the bottom of the line of Elevation, and from their ſections F and H, to raiſe the Perpendiculars F M and H K, between the lines M F, which are drawn at the point E. Then to take its Meaſures with a Compaſs, and to bring them Perpendicularly upon the Angles; for example, to take with a Compaſs the height F M, and to bear it Perpendicularly upon the lines elevated from the Angles A B, which will be A G, B G. Then to take alſo the height H K, and to carry it upon the Angles of the bottom C D, which ſhall give C O D O; then to joyn the right lines G O O G. This ſhall be the Cube elevated.</p>
               <p>If you would have the Elevation of any Figure whatſoever, draw always from the Angles of its Plane, Parallels to the baſe, unto the draught of the foot of the line of Elevation, and keep the ſame Method that we ſpake of for the Cube, and you ſhall ſee, that there is not any thing, how difficult and unequal ſoever it be, but that you may put into Perſpective; as we ſhall make to be ſeen in the Poligones fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Figure is another Cube elevated, after a manner, very little different from the former, which <hi>I</hi> ſhall ſpeak of in three words: And he that will may uſe it, not to be rejected.</p>
               <p>Having made the Plane by the ordinary way, we muſt from all its Angles B C D E, elevate Perpendiculars; And upon the firſt, ſet the height which one would give to it, as B A C A. And from the points A A, to draw to the points of ſight F, or to the points of diſtances G H, and where the Perpendiculars of the Angles D E ſhall be divided at the point I L, this ſhall be the line of ſinking, and the top of the Cube whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly elevated.</p>
               <p>This laſt Order is not ſo univerſal as the former, which hath always been in uſe, and practiſed by the Ancient Authors: It hath neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſome benefits, which we ſhall know in ſome of the Orders fol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

               <p>Having framed a Plane by the Orders foregoing <hi>fol.</hi> 21: where we teach to make it with a Liſt or Border: we muſt, as we were ſpeaking, ſet the line of Elevation on the ſide of ſuch an height as we would have, as is A B of three feet: Then from all the Angles of the Plane, to draw Parallels to the baſe, unto the bottom of the line of Elevation B E; And from their ſections elevate Perpendicules between the lines A B, and to bring all theſe heights upon the Angles from whence the Parallels pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; for example, the height A B muſt be carried to the Angles C D, which will give C R and D S. The other height F I, at the Angles G O, which will give G T and O V; That of H L to the Angle K, which will give K X; and the laſt height N P to the Angle Q, which will give Q Y.

If you would make one of the ſame, ſee here the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: Having made a Plane, and elevated occult Perpendiculars, as we have ſaid, you muſt ſet the height that you would give unto it, at the firſt Angle E F, and draw from the point F to the points B C, for to have the height of the ſecond and third Angle at the point G: Then from this point G, to draw again to the points B C, and you ſhall have the fourth Angle of the Platform. The other little Bodies are elevated in the ſame manner, by ſetting the height that one would give them, upon the firſt Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular, as from F to H, and from H drawing to the points, as we ſaid but now from the point F, we ſhall have the heights of all the Angles; And the points I K ſhall give the thickneſſes of all the little Bodies, and the Platform of that of the midſt: by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always to the Points B and C: The reſt is ſeen ſufficiently by the Figure, which one may make to ſerve for a Caſtle, defended with four ſquare Towers, or for a Palace quartered with four Pavilions.</p>
               <p>The two other Bodies which are on either ſide of the great one, are ſeen from the ſide, whereof the Order is alike to that which is ſeen from the front: for example, if you elevate Perpendiculars from all the Angles of the Plane L, and that you give your height to the firſt, as M N, by drawing from the point N, to the points of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances B C, they will give the Angles 2 and 3 at the point O. Then from the point O, drawing ſtill to the points B C, you ſhall have the fourth, which is the Elevation of the whole. This being practiſed by the firſt, and by the ſecond Order you ſhall have the ſame.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Figure below is of the ſame Order. There is no difference, but of the Horizon, which is lower.</p>
               <p>The third ſheweth the under-part of the Objects, but the order is altogether the ſame with that above, drawing all to the points of diſtances Q R, which is the Horizontal line.</p>

And draw theſe 4 Letters A B C D, to the point of ſight K, and where they ſhall divide this Parallel to the Horizon M N, at the point O, you muſt raiſe Perpendiculars of ſuch height as one would: ſee here already the breadth of the Door: for the height, you muſt tranſport D F E, of the Plane below to the Corner of the Wall I, and draw theſe Points F E, to the Point K, and where they ſhall divide the Perpendicular M P, at the Point Q, draw Q R, Parallel to M N, which ſhall give the height of the Door, and the Band above. Its thickneſs, or depth ſhall be the ſame, with that of the Wall, which is G F, and if you draw from the point G, to the point of ſight K, it will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Perpendicule M P, at the point S, draw S T, parallel to Q R, you ſhall have the bottom of the Door V, which is its thickneſs, and of the whole circuit of the Door.</p>
               <p>For to make the Door to the Wall on the ſide; you muſt remember the Order of fol. 17. which is, that one ſet all the meaſures upon the baſe, and drawing from theſe meaſures to the point of diſtance, one hath all the abridgements that he deſireth. Example, you would have a Door 4 feet within the Chamber, you ſhall ſet 4 equal diſtances I C. Then draw to the point of diſtance L, the meaſures of the Door C A, and B D. And where the Ray I M, ſhall be divided by the points elevated of the Perpendiculars X Y, which ſhall give the breadth of the Door. For its height, you muſt draw to the point of ſight K, the points E F, and the ſections of the Perpendiculars X Y, ſhall give you it! For the thickneſs above and below you muſt draw the thickneſs the Wall G H, and F I to the point of ſight K; then drawing a little parallel to the baſe or to the Horizon, from the corner of the Door X, and as much from the corner above, you ſhall have X Z, the thickneſs above and below, which you muſt joyn with a Perpendicular, as you ſee in the figure.</p>
               <p>If you would alſo have a Door on the other ſide, you have only to draw lines pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels to the baſe from the point X, to the Ray I N, and then to elevate them as we have ſaid, the reſt is the ſame with the ſide ſhadowed. The Door of the bottom is not in the midſt, that is to ſay, a foot and half; the which I have made on purpoſe for to reprove the error of thoſe, who without other meaſures, draw two Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agonals from their Picture, although it be of an enormous greatneſs, and would that all the Objects ſhould be equally diſtant from the ſection of theſe lines: that is to ſay, from the midſt of the Picture, ſo that according to their account, it ſhould be alwayes mounted for to ſee their work in its perfection, in which they deceive themſelves; for when a Picture ſhall have fourty foot of height, and that it ſhould be for to be ſeen ſet upon the Ground, we ſhould not ſet the Horizon higher then five feet, and rather leſs then more.

               <head>For to frame Windows in Perſpective.</head>
               <p>THE Order for to make a window, is altogether the ſame with that of a door, for if you make an Aſcent or a Croſs-bar within a door, it will be a window and no more a door, ſo that there is no more then to learn to make a ſingle Croſs or double, and you ſhall know to make windows. If you would make one in the wall A B of ſuch largeneſs as you ſhall pleaſe; you muſt ſet its meaſure upon the baſe, as D E, and draw from theſe points D E, to the point of diſtance F, and from the ſection which the points G ſhall make at the Ray A C, you muſt raiſe the Perpendicules G H, which ſhall give the bredth of the window, which is here but of two little ſquares: for the height, they make them ordinarily the neareſt that they can to the Plancher above; But, the Reſt or Stay ought not to be higher then of three feet, or three feet and an half. Having then taken this Meaſure, you muſt ſet it upon the Perpendicular A B, as A I, and to draw I K. And where this line ſhall divide G H, that ſhall be the reſt, a ſtay: And likewiſe drawing L, which is above to the point of ſight K, the ſection of G H ſhall be the upper part of the window, the which will give us a long ſquare, or Parallelogramma, to the which adding a Croſs, it will be a window; for to make this Croſs-bar, you muſt divide the ſpace D E into two equal parts. And at this diviſion to give ſuch a bredth as you ſhall pleaſe, ordinarily it is four inches, or at the moſt halfe a foot. And to draw this bredth M, to the point of diſtance F, and from the ſection of the Ray A C, to elevate the Perpendicules N O, which ſhallbe the aſcent or Riſing of the midſt of the window for the Croſs-bars, you ſhall ſet therein as many as you pleaſe; there is nothing but to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this, that they ought to have as much thickneſs as the riſing pillar; wherefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken this Meaſure M, you muſt tranſport it upon the Perpendicule A B, as is P, and draw this Meaſure to the point K, and the ſection that theſe Rays ſhall make of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiculars G H, G H, ſhall be the Croſs-bars; and by conſequent the window made, for its thickneſs, it is not here but of the half of the wall; for to give it to this window, you muſt draw lines occult from the point Q to the point K, and drawing little Parallels to the baſe, from the corners of the window S, they ſhall give the thickneſs at the point, that they ſhall divide the line Q X, as we have ſaid of the door.</p>
               <p>This window is equal with the wall within ſide which is not ordinary, becauſe there are that make them with Chamfrettings or Scunches, that is to ſay, that they enter within the wall, ſometimes a foot more or leſs.</p>
               <p>The Order thereof is altogether the ſame, except that in ſtead of taking the ſections upon the Ray A C K; we muſt take it at that which entreth within the wall; as far as one would cauſe the windows to enter, as may be ſeen in the figure under the Ray O K, which receiveth the Meaſures which one hath ſet upon the baſe; and that he muſt draw at the point of the diſtance F all the reſt, as at thoſe above, taking the thickneſſes of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, between the Perpendicule O unto that F, which is the laſt. Then when the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow ſhall be all finiſhed upon the Ray O K, and of the bredth of the wall O F, we muſt raiſe the Perpendicule A, and draw it to the point K. Then from the corner below the window to the points P, to make a little Parallel, which divideth the Ray A K at the point Q, which ſhall be the thickneſs of the wall, which ſhall cover a little of the window, and ſhall make the thickneſs R P to be ſeen from the point R, you muſt elevate the Perpendicule R V, which ſhall divide the Ray T K at the point V, which ſhall be the thickneſs above the window. Of the Meaſures of that, one ſhall make as much as they will, keeping there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in always the ſame Order.</p>

And between theſe two lines Q R and X X, to ſet the diviſions V, which ſhall be Y. And from all the points, to draw to the diſtance S, for to have the thickneſſes of the ſide, and of below, which ſhall be taken in the ſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Ray X T, at the point Z, from which drawing Parallels to the Horizon, you ſhall make the Plancher, as is ſeen in the ſecond fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</p>

               <head>For to frame and ſet into Perſpective Doors and round Arches.</head>
               <p>THE Round being hard to ſet into Perſpective, hath need of lines and of points which go before it, ere it can be framed: And for to finde theſe points the more eaſily, we muſt underſtand the firſt figure, by the which we ſee, that he which would have a demi-round upon the Diameter A B, hath only to ſet a leg of the Compaſs at the midſt of A B, at the point C, and with the other leg of the Compaſs to draw a crooked line from A to B, and ſo to carry his demi-round upon the Elevation D E, for to have a Door or round Arch, as in the ſecond Figure, ſo as we have ſaid.</p>
               <p>But for to ſet into Perſpective, we are to divide it into as many Parts as we will: the more that one can make is always the beſt, as we have ſaid and ſhewed at the 28th. fol. and as we ſhall ſhew, ſpeaking of croſs vaulted Roofs. We will divide this into eight Parts only, four for the half: Having made the half Circle, as we have ſaid, we muſt upon the demi-round draw a Parallel to A B, which toucheth it at the point F, and this point F ſhall be the midſt above the Circle: Then to elevate from A B two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiculars, which divide this Parallel F, at the points G H. And from the Corners A B G H, to draw two Diagonals A H G B, which ſhall divide themſelves in I, and from this point I, to elevate a Perpendicule C I F, which ſhall divide the Circle into two, and the Diagonals ſhall divide it into two other Parts at the points K, by the which we muſt draw a Parallel to the baſe K L. Let us tranſport all theſe diviſions and meaſures upon the third Figure, for to ſet them into Perſpective.</p>
               <p>Firſt, draw the Corner E to &amp; point of ſight M: Then from the point N equal to D E at the point of diſtance P, which ſhall divide the Ray E M, at the point Q. Whereby E Q will be the bredth of the firſt Arch D E, in Perſpective. Draw alſo O to the point P, it will divide the ſecond Arch at the Ray E M, or point R, not having more ſpace upon the baſe for to take the third Arch, you muſt draw from the point N to the point of ſight M; and from the point R a Parallel to the baſe R S. Seeing that R S is under the ſame Angle with E N, it is then of the ſame bredth as we have proved from the beginning: Drawing then from S to P, it will divide the Ray E M, at the point T, which ſhall be the third Arch.</p>
               <p>We muſt then elevate the Perpendiculars V, from theſe three Points Q R T, the which ſhall be divided by the Ray H M, which ſhall be the higheſt of the Arches. Then from the Ray B M, which ſhall give the lower part of the demi-round, draw Diagonals from the-points B V H X, which croſſing themſelves, ſhall give the place of the Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular Y F, which divideth the Arch into two: And drawing the Ray L M, it ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Diagonals into two, and the Arch into four. If you joyn theſe points B Z F Z K, with, crooked lines, you ſhall have the firſt Arch, and the means to make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Company of the ſame faſhion.

               <p>THAT which we are about to ſay, is only for the ſingle draught, the which being doubled, giveth the bredths and thickneſſes of the Arches, and of that which beareth them, joyning thereto right lines at all the ſections of the one to the other; as for example.</p>
               <p>Having made the firſt draught D E, as we newly ſpoke of, and drawn D E to the point of ſight A, we muſt ſet the thickneſs upon the baſe E C, by drawing C to the point of diſtance B, it will divide the Ray C A at the point F, and from this point F, to draw the Parallel to the baſe G F, which ſhall divide the Ray D A at the point G. And from F and G which ſhall be the thickneſſes, to elevate the Perpendicules I F G: If from the point H, you ſhall draw to the point A, this Ray ſhall give the height of the Perpendicular H I, upon the which you muſt take the line of the Center of the demi-round K, by drawing K to the point A, which ſhall give the point L, from which draw the Parallel L M, and this Parallel ſhall be the line which muſt bear the center of the demi-round behinde: As N, is the line of the center of the demi-circle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: you muſt divide this line M L, into two equal parts, by drawing from the point N, to the point A, by the point O, and upon this point O you muſt ſet a leg of the Compaſs, and make the half-Circle M L, the which ſhall be divided as the firſt, as we have ſaid in the figure fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going; then to draw right lines from the diviſions of the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that is to ſay, from the demi-round before to that behind, for of the two to make but one, as the figure ſheweth it, joyning M to P Q to R S F to T V, to X L, to K.</p>
               <p>or to make the Arches or round doors ſeen on the front, as D E F G, there is no need to make all theſe diviſions, ſeeing that it is ſufficient to have found the line M L, for to make the demi-round, which is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried again to the firſt N P K. But I have made them there on purpoſe, for fear of confounding the letters with the lines in this Figure below, where the Arches are view'd obliquely, or at return, by drawing to the point of the ſight Y, theſe Arches ſhall give their thickneſs, by doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the order, which we have ſpoken of in the figure preceding, and joyning the diviſion from the one to the other, as we ſpake but now, and the which is ſeen in this ſecond figure: to the which having given the thickneſs E Z, I have framed the draught E of points, and Z of full lines, thereby to avoid confuſion: and to make to underſtand, that all that which is made of Points ought not to be ſeen, the Picture being finiſhed.</p>

               <p>Having made from the Center A the demi-round, or the whole Circle B H I. You muſt from the Center A, and from the end of the Diameter B, draw Rays to the point of ſight C, then ſet upon B I the bredth or thickneſs that you would give, as is D A. And from this point D to draw to the diſtance E, and at the ſection of this line D E, upon the Ray A C to the point F, you muſt draw a Parallel to the baſe, until that it divide the Ray B C, at the point G, then to ſet one leg of the Compaſs at the point F, and with the other leg to take the diſtance G, for to make the demi-round or the whole round, which ſhall be the thickneſs of the Arch, or of the Round, as may be ſeen in the Figures. All the lines K, ought to be drawn at the Center A, and the other L, at the point of ſight C. This may ſerve for round windows made of ſtone; and theſe lines ſhall make the points, as alſo for great Veſſels, Pipes, bathing Tubs, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>I ſay then, that having framed the firſt Arch N O, as we have ſaid heretofore, we muſt make upon the firſt draught little Parallels to the baſe, in ſuch number as you ſhall pleaſe, as are theſe Q; then to take with a Compaſs the bredth, where the Arch beginneth, as is P O, and to bring it upon all theſe little Parallels Q, which ſhall give the points R, by the which we ſhall bring a crooked line, which ſhall frame the thickneſs of the Arch.</p>
               <p>It is certain, that according to Perſpective, the Objects are enlarged, when they come near to us, and that the line O P ought to be ſmaller: but in this, the difference of theſe bredths is ſo ſmall, that it ſignifies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And yet I give not this for a Rule, but for an eaſe to thoſe that are in haſte.</p>

               <p>THE Order to ſet them into Perſpective, is the ſame with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi-Round, and of the third points, as we ſee in the Figure A B. All the difficulty is to finde the draught which is made in two Manners.</p>
               <p>The firſt, by two centers, and a line or thread, as we have ſaid in the Orders before ſpeaking of the Oval, by reaſon that the Handle of a basket is properly an half-oval.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is practiſed thus: If one give you the line C D, for to make there a low Arch, which may have the height E F: you muſt from the center F, make the demi-round C G D, and to divide it into as many equal Parts as one would, as this here into twelve; and from all thoſe diviſions to draw to the Center F: then again from all theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions to draw Perpendiculars upon the line, or Diameter C D, as are the lines L. After theſe works, we muſt of the height, which one would have the Arch of, make alſo a circle, as from E F, the demi-round H E K; and from the ſections which this little circle ſhall make upon the diviſions of the great, we muſt draw little Parallels, until that they touch the Plumb lines, or Perpendiculars, which fall from the ſame diviſions: as for example L O, and from all theſe points O, frame the Arch, as we ſee it here made of Points.</p>
               <p>The other Figure maketh yet the Arch lower, and one might make it yet more couching, keeping the ſame Rules and Orders.</p>
               <p>The Figure below maketh one of theſe Arches to be in Perſpective, view'd in front, as it ought to appear, being finiſhed. <hi>I</hi> will ſet nothing of the Practice, having already ſaid, that it is the ſame with that of the demi-Rounds.</p>

But as there are a great Company of lines in this diviſion of 16 parts; I thought that it would be better to begin by a diviſion of 8, although it be not ſo exact, ſo will it alſo be leſs confuſed. We will take again the other in the following leaf.</p>
               <p>Having then made the Plane of a Round divided into eight parts, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.

               <p>Seeing that the Circle is divided into eight Parts, the Arches which are but the half of the Circle, ought to have but four, as have thoſe of the ſides: whence we ought alſo to divide into four the half-Circle before G K, at the points G P Q R K, the which ought to be drawn to the point of ſight A, unto the Circle of the bottom 5, L; Now that which followeth, is the ſecret of the Croſs; it is that we muſt draw Parallels to the Horizon, or to the baſe, from all the ſections of the Circle on the ſide 1, 2, 3, 4; 5. at the diviſions of the Circle before, in ſuch manner as G, which is the firſt diviſion of the Circle, touch in a point the firſt ſection 1. from 2 to draw a Parallel to the ſecond diviſion P, and to make a point S, from 3 to the third diviſion Q, which ſhall give O, the place of the Knot; from 4 to the fourth diviſion R at the point T, then to joyn the crooked lines G S O T L, and you ſhall have already a Diagonal; a d do as much on the other ſide, and you ſhall have the Croſs entire, and your Vault compleat.</p>

Suppoſe then that the Arch before it Q, is 40 feet broad, and that in that of the ſides, you would allow but 15, 20, or ſo much or little as you pleaſe: you muſt (according to the fourth advice in fol. 17.) ſet this Meaſure upon the baſe, and draw to the point of diſtance, which will give the ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame Meaſure in A E; as by example, we have ſet here A C of 20 feet, drawing from the point C; to the point of diſtance, which is a little farther off here where our Paper is too narrow for to cauſe it to be ſeen; it will divide the ſinking of 20 feet, upon the Ray A D, at the point E; then coming back to the Baſe, you muſt make an half-Circle of this diſtance A C, and divide it into as many parts as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Arcade F G ſhall have of diviſion, as here 8; and from all theſe diviſions I, to ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Perpendiculars I H, and from the points I H, being drawn to the point of diſtance they will divide the Ray A E, at the point O, which you muſt alſo elevate into the Perpendicular O P, you muſt make in ſome place ſeparate the Plane of this demi-round F G.

               <p>For the Thickneſſes of the Joynts of the Croſs, you are only to make a little line of Elevation <hi>a b,</hi> which I have ſet at the top of the Perpendicule elevated from the point O: and this line <hi>a b</hi> being drawn to the point of ſight D, divideth all the other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicules at the points <hi>c d,</hi> for to give the heights Proportionate to every Perpendicule elevated from the ſections of the Croſs; that is to ſay, from the ſections which muſt be made for to finde the draught of the Croſs, following their Order: for example, the firſt Elevation <hi>a b</hi> ſhall be given at the firſt Perpendicule G: The ſecond Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation <hi>c d,</hi> at the ſecond Perpendicule F, <hi>c;</hi> and ſo following for all the others, which ſhall give the points C; by the which making a crooked line for to joyn them together, we ſhall have the thickneſs of the Joynts of the Croſs of the Vault, as one may ſee at half of the left ſide of the Figure aforegoing.</p>

If one ſhall uſe little ſquares, they will have the more eaſineſs, having only to raiſe Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicules, from ſo many ſquares, as he would have ſteps: then to ſet at the firſt ſquare the line of Elevation, divided into as many Parts as one would, and from theſe diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to draw to the point of ſight, and they ſhall divide the Perpendicules where the ſteps ought to be.</p>
               <p>For example, you would have a ſtair-caſe of eight ſteps, and that the laſt may have the bredth of 3, you muſt take upon the Plane the number of little ſquares, beginning at B, as are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.8.

               <p>The firſt diviſion (four inches high, ſuppoſing the ſquare of one foot) ſhall divide the firſt Perpendicule, and it muſt be continued unto the ſecond, for that maketh alſo the upper part of the ſtep, as is E F, and ſo of the others. You ſhall make theſe ſteps as long as you would as theſe are of three feet taking, as I have ſaid, the ſquare for one foot, ſo as is B G at this diſtance. You muſt alſo raiſe Perpendicules, as we have done on the ſide B; but for to ſave this pains, it were better to take the height of the laſt ſtep H, and that of the firſt I. Then to draw the line H I, which muſt grate upon the Angles, or the outward edge of the Steps, as E K, grateth upon them on the ſide B: for this being, there is but onely to draw parallells to the Baſe from all the Steps on the ſide B, untill that they divide the line H I, as we ſee L M N O P Q, &amp;c. without making ſquares; we need only to ſet the Meaſures upon the Baſe, and to draw them to the point of diſtance.

               <head>For winding Stairs with Reſts in Perſpective.</head>
               <p>WE muſt remember the fore-going orders about Steps, and it will be eaſie to frame theſe winding Stairs, but to avoid the pains of ſearching, we will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold the whole matter here.</p>
               <p>By reaſon that the winding Stairs of this figure, have ordinarily twice as much at the bottom, as they are broad: When one would raiſe then into Perſpective, he ſhall firſt ſet the Horizon, where he would. Then he muſt make a ſquare, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary rules, and double it according to the ſecond advice of Fol. 16. and to divide this ſquare by an unequal number of little ſquares, that the Walls which ſhould be in the midſt, may be of the meaſure of one little ſquare.</p>
               <p>In this figure each ſquare hath 9 ſides, or little ſquares of each ſide, the which being doubled maketh 18. for all the hollow: Of theſe 18. you muſt leave 4 at each end for the Reſts; there remains 10 little ſquares, which we will make to contain 1 foot e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evry way, of which we ſhall make ten Steps, or degrees, as followeth.</p>
               <p>Having left 4 ſquares A B, beginning at the point A, which holdeth the place of the Wall, we will raiſe a good height the Perpendicule B, then the ſecond C, and the third D, and ſo from the other Angles of the ſquares, until that one have made the 10. which we have here: This being done on the one ſide; you ſhall do as much on the other, and all theſe Perpendicules ſhall give the depths of the ſteps.</p>
               <p>For the height, if they have one foot of depth, or breadth, we ſhall give them one half foot of height, which is the half of the little ſquare A O: this height being taken with a compaſs, we muſt ſet it upon the firſt corner, which ſhall ſerve as for the line of elevation, beginning all below at the point A, and to mark it as many times, as we would make Steps, as here 10 unto the firſt Reſt, from which we begin to aſcend again on the other ſide oppoſite, where which we ſhall take again the Reſt of the numbers following are marked there on the one ſide, and other unto the 23.</p>
               <p>From all theſe 23 points, we muſt draw to the point of ſight E, and to take heed to divide the Perpendicules, according to their order, that is to ſay, that having placed the rule upon the firſt point, and at the point of ſight E; we muſt divide the firſt Perpendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular B, unto C, with a ſmall draught for the firſt Step: For the ſecond Step, we muſt from the ſecond point divide the ſecond Perpendicular C; unto D And ſo of all as well of one ſide, as the other</p>
               <p>From all the Angles of theſe ſmall draughts between the Perpendiculars, we muſt draw parallels to the Horizon, unto the Wall F, which is raiſed in the midſt, as are the ſmall draughts I I I I, which I have made only on one ſide, for to avoid confuſion. It is only theſe parallels, which muſt frame the Steps: All that is, made unto that, ought to be of occult lines, which ought not to be ſeen, when the figure is finiſhed.</p>
               <p>The Reſts ought to be taken from the defect of the laſt Perpendiculars unto the Wall, as from G, unto H, their thickneſs H K, is of one half foot, as of one Step.</p>

               <p>YOU muſt ſet upon the baſe one ſide of the Aſcent, and divide it into ſo many Parts, as you would ſet ſteps there: for example, the ſide of the ſtairs let be the diſtance A B, if you would have 16 ſteps for the whole Circuit of the ſquare, each ſide ſhall have four: This is, why this Meaſure A B being divided into four, you muſt make thereof a ſquare divided into ſixteen, according to the Orders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-going.</p>
               <p>From all the outward diviſions which divide into four the lines of each ſide, you muſt raiſe Perpendicules which will give the bounds of the ſteps. Let then the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicules be A A, B B, C C, D D, E E. This E E made for three, by reaſon that the point is in the midſt; for that it ſerveth for the Nuell or Spindle, which is the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of all, and the half of the line before, and of that of the bottom, there follow F F, G G, H H, I I, K K, L L, M M, N N, O O, P P.</p>
               <p>You muſt ſet upon the firſt Perpendicule A. which we will make to ſerve for lines of elevation, the height of one ſtep or degree Q A: And from the point Q, you muſt draw to the point of ſight X, for to have the Meaſures of all the ſteps at the ſections of the Perpendiculars Q R S T V: A Q is the height of the firſt, F R of the ſecond, G S of the third, H T of the fourth, and I V of the fifth; this of all thoſe of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, as A Q, is of all thoſe before.</p>
               <p>Seeing that G S is the meaſure of the third, which is the midſt of the ſide; it muſt alſo be the meaſure of the Center, and of the Nuell of the ſtairs; therefore having taken this Meaſure G S, with the Compaſſes, we muſt carry it to the Center of the ſquare; and mark it in going upwards, as many times as we would ſet ſteps in the whole Aſcent, as I have ſet it here eighteen times for eighteen ſteps or degrees.</p>
               <p>All being ordered in this manner, the reſt is eaſie enough, ſeeing that for to make the firſt ſtep, we muſt take the meaſure A Q, and carry it upon the Perpendicular D, to the point I; and from this point I to make a Parallel unto the other Perpendicule B; then from theſe two points I I, upon the Perpendiculars to draw to the other I, which is at the Center of the ſquare; theſe three III will frame the firſt ſtep. For the ſecond, ſeeing that its Corner cometh to the Perpendicule B, which is on the ſide before, you muſt give it the ſame meaſure A Q, which ſhall be 1, 2. And from the point 2, to draw to the point of fight X, for to divide the Perpendicule P, or the point 2, from the which points 2, 2, Perpendiculars, you muſt draw to 2 of the Center, which will frame the ſecond ſtep. For the third, ſeeing that it meeteth upon the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular P, you muſt take the meaſure F R for its height, and do as at the ſecond; and ſo of all the others.</p>
               <p>He that would make them round, needeth but only to reduce the ſquare into Round, according to the Orders aforegoing, and he ſhall have the ſame facility wholly as in the ſquare, in whatſoever remaineth.</p>

For to know to give the 2 lines D E, which make the thickneſs, or the Diameter of the round: We muſt take notice where the round divideth the Diagonal of the ſquare, and to hold for a general maxime, that it ought always to be taken at the round pieces ſeen from the ſide, as it is in the figure C, that the Perpendicules are elevated from the ſection of the round, upon the Diagonal of the ſquare, at the points D E</p>
               <p>For the pieces viewed by the Front, as the figure F, they ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to poſſeſs the Demy-round G H I, and to elevate the Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les of the Diameter right G H, and from the one and the other, as well on Front, as on Side, we muſt elevate a line from the Center, which ſhall ſerve to give the Diminutions to the Columns.</p>

               <p>IN purſuit of Columns, which are the principal Ornament of Architecture, we will ſet the Corniſhes or Mouldings, with their Projectors, which we have not ſet hitherto, for fear of giving confuſion to the Elevations, which it behoveth to be underſtood with clearneſs and eaſineſs.</p>
               <p>It is true that there are not many Buildings made, which have not ſome few Mouldings and Projector for their Ornament, for to make them more pleaſing to the eye: where-I thought fit to ſet here the manner, not of framing them, ſeeing that dependeth on the pleaſure of every one, nor to give them their Meaſures and Projectors, for that were to oblige my ſelf to ſit down here, the Orders of Architecture, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other Inventions of Ornaments, which one may finde elſewhere, and which I ſuppoſe are known. But only to ſet them into Perſpective, according to the Orders following, when any ſhall have occaſion for ſuch an Order.</p>
               <p>For to ſet then the Ornaments for a Pilaſter in Perſpective, we muſt take the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures upon the middle line of ſome other with its Ornaments, as is A B, of which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken the bredth, and made a ſquare Plane in the ordinary way; and from this ſquare to elevate from all the Angles Perpendiculars, we ſhall frame the body or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid part of the Pilaſter.</p>
               <p>Then we muſt only take that which projects it ſelf from the body; for example, the baſe of the Pilaſter C, and tranſport its meaſures as in D E. for to ſet it in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective round about the Pilaſter: we muſt from the point of diſtance F draw a line Diagonal, which paſſeth forth of the ſquare to the point E unto G, it is no matter for the length: Then from the point A to make a Ray paſſing to the lower part of the Projector H; and at the point where this Ray ſhall divide the Diagonal at I, it ſhall be the advancement of the whole baſe: the ſame Ray A H ſhall give the Projector of the bottom, by dividing the other Diagonal at the point K: Then for the Projector be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we muſt from the point I draw a Parallel to the baſe, until that it divide the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agonal, which ſhall give the other Corner of the Projector before at the point L; then drawing lines of the height of the Baſe unto theſe points, as are M to L, from D to I, from N to K, you ſhall have the bredth and the hight of all the Baſe; The Capitall is made of the ſame faſhion. Here is for the firſt figures above.</p>
               <p>Thoſe below ſhall Cauſe the reſt to be known, and ſhall avoid Confuſion. For the Pilaſters O, we muſt obſerve that above P, where the line D H, bereth all the ſections of the baſe; Wherefore from the point of ſight A, we muſt draw Rays, the which paſſing by the diviſions of D H, muſt marke them upon the lines D I, and N K; And drawing Parallels from the points of D I, to M L, there will be no more then to give the Turnings about, or wheelings as the ſhape of the Colum. When you ſhall meet with ſquares, or Flat-bands, either above or below they are made by Perpendicular. As for to make the Plinth, you muſt raiſe Perpendiculars from the Points L I K; the from the point of ſight A, to paſs by the Corner of the Plinth Q, it will give the height upon the Perpendicules I, and K. Then L muſt be equall to L.</p>
               <p>I beleeve that this Inſtruction for the Baſe, will ſuffice for to make the Capitall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Order. This laſt Pilaſter R, is only for to cauſe one to be ſeen without being mingled with lines.

               <p>IT is the ſame Order with that which we have explained, but as it is ſomewhat difficult by the multitude of lines, I thought it convenient to ſet it down again here, for to avoid confuſion.</p>
               <p>I ſay then, that having taken the pourfill of the Projector and the Corniſh, that one would make, we muſt ſet it at the place, where one would make it, as C which is the pourfill is at the corner of the Wall A B, for to find the height which it ought to have, and to make thoſe below ſeen, we muſt from the point of ſight D, draw a Ray paſſing by the end of the pourfill E, as is D F; then to make a line Diagonal from the point of diſtance H, paſſing by the corner of the Wall B, and to continue it until that it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Ray D E at the point F, from which you ſhall draw the line F G, which muſt be the Angle in Perſpective, for to receive all the meaſures F G, the corner of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end of the Wall K L, is drawn from the other diſtance I, as being the other Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonal.</p>
               <p>In the figure marked 2. we ſhall ſee, that all the figures which are upon the line M N, muſt be tranſported by viſual Rays from the point of ſight D, upon the line N O, for to draw Parallels to the Horizon from all theſe points, which ſhall give the whole Corniſh perfect. But before we paſs any further, we muſt mark, as I have already ſaid, that all the flat-bands and ſquares are made by Perpendiculars. For example, for to make this great ſquare of the Corniſh, having made the Wave or Ogee, and the filet under the filet, which muſt be the height of the ſquare, we muſt abaſe the Perpendicule, P Q. Then for to know where it muſt be divided for to make the under part be ſeen, we muſt draw from the point of diſtance I, by the point above the quarter of the round R, unto the Perpendicule P Q. and you ſhall have that which you ſeek. That which I have ſaid of the great ſquare, muſt be underſtood of little ones, as are ſmall mouldings, the filets, &amp;c becauſe that they muſt all make that below to be ſeen.</p>
               <p>The third figure ſheweth, that having found all the points, and drawn Rays upon this line, from the Angle S T, we muſt there trace out or ſhape the mouldings out proportionally: I mean, that when theſe ſhall project themſelves, as this here doth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that its point of diſtance is near, we muſt help the mouldings, that is to ſay, a little bend down the quarter of the Round, ſet up the Ogee, enlarge the filets, and mark at one end the ſame that at the other; as at V X, the ſame that at S T after that, there is no more but to draw parallels to the baſe, and all ſhall be done</p>
               <p>The fourth figure ſheweth the Corniſh wholly made: I have drawn parallels from all the points of the line of the Angle Y Z; I have made an end of the Wall to paſs upon the Corniſh, for to give to underſtand, that one hath liberty for to make it throughout, and that our rule is general for to make it where they would.</p>

               <p>SEeing that hitherto we have followed very near the Order which they keep in raiſing of Buildings; whatſoever they be, we ought to follow in teaching the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Garniſhing them, and making them fitting for to lodge in: I will begin by the doors of wood; afterwards we will ſpeak of other Openings, as of Windows, Cupboards, Cheſts, &amp;c. Then of Moveables, Tables, Beds, Chairs, Coffers, Settles, Benches, &amp;c,</p>
               <p>All the doors, which are made for to open and ſhut, depend of the Will of every one, who may open them more or leſs, as he pleaſeth; wherefore I will teaeh to ſet them into Perſpective, at ſuch opening as one would have.</p>
               <p>We muſt obſerve that the Doors, Windows, Cupboards, Cheſts, and in ſhort all things that may open and ſhut, do make always a demi-round in their whole opening. The reaſon is, that the ſide which is faſtned by the hinges or hooks, doth not ſtir from its place; and the other ſide moveth and maketh a demi-Circle, as a pair of Compaſſes would do.</p>
               <p>For example, in the Plane under the Figure, if the ſide faſtned be at the point A, and the other ſide at B, if you would open the door fully, the ſide B ſhall make the demi-round B C D, whereof the center ſhall be A, as one may ſee: from whence one may know, that if the door hath theee feet of bredth, as theſe have; it ſhall have alſo three feet for its Diameter A C; And 6 feet for the Diameter entire B A D, of which ſix feet in length, and 3 of bredth, we muſt make a Plane of 18 little ſquares, for which we ſhall make the demi-round A B C D, for to give a facility to make the ſame demi-rounds in the Perſpective. by obſerving where the demi-round of the Plane divideth the little ſquares, for to divide in the ſame proportion thoſe of the Perſpective, and there to make a demi-round, which ſhall take up as many of the little ſquares, and ſhall divide them in the ſame place, as we ſee at the door E, where the ſections are marked, as in the plane below 1, 2, 3; 4, 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p>When one would make an open door in Perſpective, he muſt upon its Plane make a demi-round; then to ſet the point of the opening in what place he will, upon this demi-round; as for the door E, the point of the opening is at the point 2. from this point 2, he muſt elevate a Perpendicular 2. H. And again from the ſame point 2, draw a line paſſing by the corner of the door F, and continue it until that it divide the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon which is at the point G, from which he muſt draw another line, making it to paſs by the other corner of the door I, and to continue it till it divide the Perpendicule rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the point 2, which ſhall be at the point H, and you ſhall have the door open, as is F I H, 2.</p>
               <p>All the Openings are made by the ſame Rules, as are ſeen by the doors K and L; the door K ſheweth its out-ſide, and the door L ſheweth its inſide; nevertheleſs, the one and the other are ordered in the manner as the firſt; the point accidental of K is the point M, within the Horizon. And that of the door L is O. If one make to theſe doors, barrs, locks, and ſuch like things, they muſt be drawn from the ſame accidental point, as the barr and the lock of the door L, draw to the point O. Theſe are the points which they call Accidental, as I have expreſſed in the beginning of our Orders, and all the Openings make but one within the Horizon, except two ſorts of Openings. The one when the door is wholly opened, for then it hath its point at the point of ſight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is at the wall. The other, when it is Parallels to the Horizon, becauſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels never divide themſelves but are drawn right, as is the door N.</p>

               <p>ALL the difference that there is in the openings of windows, from thoſe of the doors, is, that the doors have the demi-round of their opening upon the Plane, and the windows have it in the Air: by reaſon that the windows make their Openings being elevated from the Ground, and the doors do grate upon it: wherefore we muſt make this demi-round above or below the windows; and within this demi-round to take the point for to open them.</p>
               <p>For example, if the ſide of the window hath 2 ſmall ſquares of bredth, as A B, and that one give it its whole opening, it will take up two more ſquares C A, whereof A is the middle, and the center of the demi-circle A B C. But by reaſon that the windows are elevated from the Ground, the demi-round al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo muſt be elevated, as they are here above the windows from the corners D and E, which are the centers of theſe demi-rounds, which ſhall be eaſily fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, raiſing Perpendiculars from the ſquares, which are between C and B, until that they divide the Rays, which paſs by the corners of the windows D E. And from theſe ſections you muſt draw to the baſe, and give them the meaſures of the little ſquares of the plane 1, 2, 3. from which points 1, 2, 3. on high, you muſt draw lines to the point of ſight F, which ſhall divide the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels of points, and frame the little ſquares, for to make the rounds of the openings, which ſhall be taken in the ſame manner as at the doors; as if one give within the higheſt demi-round the point G, for the point of the opening from this point G, you muſt draw 2 lines, the one which falleth plumbe G H, the other which paſſeth by the corner of the window E, for to divide the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon where it can, which is here the point I; from this point I you muſt alſo a line by the corner of the window K, until that it divide the line plumb at the point H, which ſhall give the window open K E G H; we muſt do the ſame of all the others, and take the point within the Horizon; as L is the point for the window M; and N is that of the window O. The window P hath none, being Parallel to the Horizon.</p>
               <p>The windows which are oppoſite are made by the ſame method, without the confuſion of lines, the one and the other are equal with the wall, for to facilitate the ordering thereof. The door at the bottom is made as we have ſaid, and the window followeth the Method of theſe.</p>

               <p>The Cup-boards A, are opened according to the Orders of the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and it would be loſs of time to buſie Ones-ſelf in repeating them here, we are to obſerve only, that one height is Parallel to the Horizon, and the other below draweth to the point of diſtance B.</p>
               <p>This Manner of Shop, which is on the other ſide, hath its Opening with two Shuts, whereof one is lifted on high, and the other cometh down below, and each maketh its demi-round from the Center C and D which one maketh with the Compaſſes then we may take the Openings where we will, as here at the point E, from which we draw a Ray to the point of ſight F, untill we divide the demi-rounds of the other end, at the point G, from which points E G, we muſt draw to the Centers C D, for to have the Shuts, which cloſe up the Shop as we ſee.</p>
               <p>In the figure below, there are 3 Cheſts opened ſeveral ways for to open the firſt H, I have made the quarter of a round M, in Perſpective, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Meaſure of the little ſquares of the Plane, keeping the bredth of the Cheſt, as this is of 2 little ſquares, from which we muſt raiſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiculars, and thereof frame the half or quarter of a Round, for the opening which we may take at pleaſure, as here the point N, from which we muſt draw a Parallel unto the other quarter of the round O, and from theſe 2 points N O, to draw to the Center P, If we would open it wider, we muſt make a demi-round inſtead of a quarter.</p>
               <p>The Cheſt I, is the moſt eaſie of all the Openings; for having taken the bredth of the Cheſt Q R, we muſt from the center R, make with the Compaſſes the demi-round Q S.

               <p>I Had ſet theſe planes in their order, among the others, had there not been one conſideration, which made me defer them until now, which is, that if I had hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them in the beginning, without making known the neceſſity thereof, they would have been alſo too ſoon forgot and held as unuſeful: they are now more ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and without doubt they will be well received, pleaſing, and learned with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſeeing there are not only moveables, nor peices of houſhold-ſtuff, which depend not thereon.</p>
               <p>The firſt plane A, ſerveth for Beds, Tables, Chairs, Stools, low Stools, &amp;c. The other B, which beareth in length, two times its breadth, ſerveth for long Tables, Cabinet, Court Cup-boards, Coffers, Trunks. The third C, which is long and narrow, ſerveth for Benches or Forms, and other things which have need of ſix Feet, or Pillars, as great Tables, and Cup-boards.</p>
               <p>The knowledge that one hath of other planes, will give the facility of making theſe, ſeeing there is nothing but to ſet their meaſures upon the baſe, to draw them to the point of ſight, and to abridge them by the points of diſtances.</p>
               <p>For example, for the plane A, you muſt ſet upon the baſe theſe two meaſures D E, and draw them to the point of ſight F, then from one of the diſtances, you muſt draw to one of theſe meaſures, as here E, to the diſtance G, and where that ſhall divide the Rayes at the points H I, you muſt draw parallels, for to frame the 4 little ſquares, which one may make to be for as much, or as little as he will. Becauſe for a Table, they muſt be of more bigneſs then for a ſettle or ſtool, that is to ſay, that they muſt have more breadth, for if for this we allow 2 inches, for that there muſt be four.</p>
               <p>The plane B, is made of the ſame manner, except that by reaſon of its length, which is the double of the breadth, we muſt draw from the point B, to one of the diſtances, for to find the half K, for if one ſhould draw from the point L, he would divide at the point M, which would be the whole ſquare; and we would have but the half: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore from the point K, we muſt draw parallels to the ſections of the Ray; and from the corner L, we ſhall divide alſo the Ray for the firſt ſquares at the point N.</p>
               <p>The other plane C, hath no need of explication; for we ſee well, that it is made as that A, and that you muſt double the ſquare for to have 6 little ſquares.</p>
               <p>We ſee at the figure below, that from all the Angles of theſe ſquares, you muſt raiſe Perpendiculars for to begin to give the frame to the pieces that we ſhall make here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>

               <p>HAving raiſed the Perpendiculars of the Plane, as aforeſaid, we muſt in ſome Place of the Picture make the line of Elevation, upon the which we ſhall ſet the croſs-lines or Travers, and the height that one would give them.</p>
               <p>For example, the line C D ſhall be the line of Elevation, and C E and D F ſhall be the bredths for the Travers; from all theſe four points, we muſt draw in ſome place within the Horizon, as here at the point G. Then having from the Planes A B, raiſed the Perpendiculars from all the Angles, we muſt from the ſame Angles draw Parallels to the baſe unto the Ray C G, which is the bottom of the line of Elevation, which will give the points 1, 2, 3, 4. which we muſt raiſe into Perpendiculars; and the ſections which theſe Perpendiculars ſhall make, at the Ray C E, D F, ſhall be the points to divide the Perpendiculars of the Planes, whither we carry them with the Compaſſes, or that we divide them with Parallels, as we ſee in the Figure. That drawing a Parallel from the point E, we ſhall divide the firſt Perpendicules of the Planes A B, at the points O, from which drawing to the point of ſight H, we ſhall divide the other Perpendiculars of the Planes at the points P; and doing the ſame from the point F, we ſhall frame a Cube pierced round on all ſides, or compoſed of ſquare pieces; the which being well underſtood, we ſhall eaſily make all the Pieces following, and whatſoever other may be.</p>
               <p>It is eaſie to ſee that the two frames or feet of the Tables I and K, are made by the ſame Order that thoſe above A B, they having no difference but in the Barre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, which is more elevated in the line of Elevation at the point L, which giveth the Barre M, and that which is under may be made into Bowles, or to leave the feet ſquare as they are.</p>
               <p>For the latter frame N and Q, there is no more then in I and K, except that they are ſeen by the Angle, and the others are ſeen in front: the Planes of theſe I and K draw to the point of ſight R, and theſe draw to the diſtances S T.</p>

This Hollow is given at pleaſure, ſetting upon the baſe, that which we will give it; for example, for to have the hollow or bredth of this Cupboard, I have ſet the Meaſure F L, from this point L, we muſt draw to the diſtance M, and where the Ray F H ſhall be divided at the point L, that ſhall be the place of the laſt Aſcent.</p>
               <p>The Cup-board which is over againſt on the other ſide, is ordered in the ſame manner, and for to finde the Meaſure of this little Cabinet which is in the midſt, bore up by two little Columns, we muſt take the points L P, which are in the midſt of Q N, and the bredth of the little Cabinet, and draw them to the diſtance O; and where the Ray N H ſhall be divided, we muſt draw Parallels to the baſe, which ſhall divide the Ray T H at the point V, from which raiſing Perpendiculars, we ſhall have for the little Cabinet of the middle.</p>
               <p>The great Cabinet of the ſecond figure, are of the ſame Order with the Court Cup-boards above. There is none but that of the midſt, which is at the bottom, which we muſt a little explain, by reaſon that it is of the front, and that one might be in ſome trouble for to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine its hollow, I ſay then, we muſt frame its Plane, as we have ſaid heretofore, and as we ſee it finiſhed in the half; for to give it the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes equal to the firſt in the fore-part; we muſt from the firſt Aſcent R, draw occult Rays to the firſt Perpendicular of the hollow S, and there to make little ſections, from which we muſt draw little Paralels to the baſe; and we ſhall have that we deſire.</p>

               <p>FOR to elevate a Chair, you muſt of the Meaſures A B C, make a Plane by the ordinary Rules, and from the Angles of this Plane, elevate Perpendicules, and follow the ſame Method that we have given, ſpeaking of the feet of the Table, or of the frames for windows, without the upper part: there is nothing more in this then the Back of the Chair, which one may make of ſuch an height as they will: here it is the height of A, unto the ſeat K, and this height is as well for the ſingle Chairs, as for thoſe with Reſts to lean on. We ſee ſufficiently by the Figure, that for to make them with backs, we muſt only prolong the Perpendicules of the Aſcents on the ſide, that we would make it, as is here the firſt A E; and from the point E drawing to the point of ſight G. We ſhall divide where it ought the Aſcent ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated from the Plane, or from the foot H, which ſhall be the point F. The reſt is clear enough by the Figure.</p>
               <p>When we would have Reſts there, we need only to prolong the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents before, as they have made theſe behind for the back. Then to make there a Barr which ſerveth for a Reſt, as is L M.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond Figure below you ſee a Form or a Bench garniſhed with carving, and two little Couches to reſt in, whereof one hath the back turned on this ſide, and the other view'd obliquely: It would be to loſe the time to inſtruct how to make them, ſeeing that the Order to elevate them, is the fame with the foregoing, which we have given for the Moveables, which is, that having made the Plane, we muſt elevate Perpendiculars, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>We muſt only make the elevation, as if for a Cube; as is A B, C D, or E F G H.

               <p>In this piece which is below, I have made a Table upon Treſſels, that we may have the ſmalleſt moveables for to ſet them into Perſpective.

Then from the Angles of the ſmall ſquares of the plane, to draw lines bending unto the piece I. The ſecond Treſſel is ordered all alike with the firſt</p>

               <p>WHen the moveables are ſet in order along by the Wall, or according to the Rays and the baſe, it is eaſie to ſet them into Perſpective, by the Rules that we have given; but ſuppoſing that one ſet them by chance, and without order, as theſe are, we muſt do as I ſhall ſay. You muſt make the Geometrical plane R S T, for the plane of three Chairs, which you muſt abridge by the Order that we have ſet at the irregular figure, Fol 40. and the planes ſhall remain turned, as are the Chairs, or rather the Chairs turned, as are the planes.</p>
               <p>I ſay then, that having ſet theſe planes into Perſpective, as it is taught, you muſt ſet the Rule along by one of the ſides, for to ſee what accidental point, you ſhall have within the Horizon: For example, having ſet the Rule along by the ſide A B, I ſhall have within the Horizon the point C, for the accidental point, at which we ought to draw all the lines of this ſide, and of that which is oppoſite to it, as we ſee that A and D, draw to the ſame point C: It is true that every plane ſet irregularly muſt have 2; But they meet ſometime ſo far within the Horizon that it is a hazard when one can find them both together Theſe have each one within the Horizon, as A B, giveth C. A D, which is the other ſide, ſhould give another point, but our paper is not long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. E F, giveth G And H I, giveth K, for theſe ſmall ſquares 1.2.3.4. they are the plains of the Feet of theſe Chairs, which one may make more large, or more ſtreight, at the pleaſure of the Artiſt.</p>
               <p>Now from theſe planes, you muſt elevate Perpendicules from all the Angles, and ſet on the ſide a line of elevation M N, upon the which we muſt ſet the meaſure for the Travers, as O, ſhall be for the Bars below, P, for the bars of the ſeat. And Q ſhall be for the backs of the Chairs. All being diſpoſed thus, we muſt from the Angles of the plane draw parallels to the baſe, unto the line of Elevation, and at the ſection to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levate Perpendicules, which ſhall give the meaſures, as we have ſaid of other figures heretofore.</p>
               <p>All the lines of the ſides ought to draw to the point accidentall of the plane: For example, in the chair of the midſt, all the ſides ought to draw to the point G, which is the point of the plane, as I make it to be ſeen in the figure.</p>

               <p>We muſt raiſe Perpendiculars from all the Angles of the Plane, and give to the Side lying the ſame Meaſures, as to the ſide upright: For example, having raiſ'd Perpendiculars from all the Angles of the Plane, we ſhall have the bredth M, which is in the Chair lying upon its ſide, which draweth to the point K; we muſt double this Meaſure M, which will give O for the Barre below of the Chair, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicules elevated from the Plane, will give the Barr of the Seat P; from which drawing to the point K, we ſhall divide the other Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculars of the front at the place that it ought, for to make the ſame Barrs appear from all the ſides whence they may be ſeen; for the height of the back of the Chair, there is but only to give to it the ſame Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that the Seat hath of height: And for the back of that in the midſt, you muſt double the Diagonal on the Plane, and take notice where it divideth the Rays or Aſcents lying R S. the reſt is clear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>

               <p>THE Order of Altars, is the ſame with that of the frames of a long Table: that which is more in this, is the Round of the midſt, the Borders of the Table-cloth, and the Laces which ſhall be found in their place, doing that which followeth.</p>
               <p>Firſt, for the body of the Altar, which we ſee in front there is no difficulty: for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given to it the height and length, there is nothing but to draw from all the points above the baſe, to the point of ſight E, and from the ſections that theſe points ſhall give to the line of the bottom of the Altar, you muſt raiſe Perpendicules for the Round of the midſt, it is made with the Compaſs. The reſt is clear enough within the Figure.</p>
               <p>For to make an Altar on the ſide, we muſt ſet the bredth and height, which we ſhould give it at the place where we would begin it, as is A B the bredth, and B D the height. Then from B D and C to draw to the point of ſight E, ſeeing that B F is the length of the body of the Altar, and that we would give the ſame to this, we muſt from the point F draw to the diſtance G, and take notice where we ſhall divide the Ray B E, and from the ſection elevate a little Perpendicular, until that it touch the Ray D at the point H, and from H to make a little Parallel, which ſhall give I at the Ray C, and then we ſhall have the upper part of the Altar C D H I: for to have theſe two laces which are on one part, and the other of the Round: the points K L will give them upon the Ray B E, by drawing them to the diſtance G, and M will give the bredth of the Borders of the Table-cloth; and having taken the meaſure B M, we muſt bring it to D, which will give O, for the bredth of the Border of the Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth on high As concerning the Round, I will not repeat that, for I have ſpoke of it elſewhere, where any may have learned, how it is ſet into Perſpective, it is enough that we know, that from all the diviſions we muſt draw to the diſtance G: And at the ſections of the Ray B to raiſe Perpendicules; then to take theſe ſame Meaſures, and tranſport them from B unto O, as are P; And from all theſe Meaſures to draw to the point of ſight E, and to obſerve where they ſhall divide the occult Perpendiculars, for to make by theſe points a crooked line, which ſhall give the Rounds in Perſpective. If inſtead of theſe laces, and of the Round, there were an Embroidery, we ſhould uſe the ſame Order for to abbreviate it</p>
               <p>In the Figure below I have made the ſame Altar without line, and adorned with a Croſs and two Candleſticks; for to finde the place of theſe Candleſticks, we muſt prolong the line of the corner of the Altar, as is Q R; then from the diſtance G draw a line by the corner of the Altar T, and to continue it until that it divide that Q R; and this line Q R ſhall be the length of the Altar, equal to B F of the firſt figure, upon the which we ſhall ſet the Meaſures of the Croſs and of the Candleſticks, as are V for the Croſs, and S for the Candleſticks; from all theſe points S V we muſt draw to the diſtance G, and take notice that at the ſections of the Ray Q E, we muſt draw little Parallels, which we ſhall divide by the Ray S E, and will give the ſquares above the Altar X for the Croſs. We muſt leave the ſquare for the foot, and from the midſt of the ſquare elevate the Croſs; for to finde the Meaſure of the Arms of the Croſs, we muſt from the corners of the ſquare raiſe the occult Perpendiculars, as it is mark'd Y, and draw to the point of ſight E for the Candleſticks Of this ſquare we muſt make a Round; and obſerve where it ſhall divide the Diagonal, for to elevate theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicules, which ſhall give the bredth of the Baſons, from the which we muſt draw to the point of ſight E, from the middle ſquare or round foot of the Candleſtick, we muſt elevate a Perpendicular for the Body of the Candleſtick, and for the Taper which we ſhall make as high as we will: for to proportion it, we muſt from the top of the firſt draw to the point of ſight E, the reſt hath already been ſaid: the Figure will cauſe us to remember the Orders.</p>

               <p>For the boxes in the Front, there is nothing but to draw Rays from the points, or meaſures E F, and at the ſection of the line of the hollow K Q, to raiſe Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars R S; And for the Travers to draw parallels from all the diviſions which ſhall be found upon the Perpendicule K, as are P. 1.

               <p>For the boxes of the other ſide, where there are aſcents in ſquare for to uphold the boards, we ſhall have their breadth, drawing to the point of ſight C, the meaſures T G, and for to have their plane, or ſquare, we muſt from the meaſures A E F, draw to the diſtance V, which ſhall give upon the Ray T C, the ſection, X Y Q, by the which we muſt draw little parallels, until that we divide the Ray T G, at the point Z. and from the Angles of theſe little ſquares to raiſe Perpendicules which ſhall be the aſcents: as we ſee clearly in the figure.</p>

               <p>When there are Windows in front, as A, and that one would ſet them in a return; which have the ſame meaſures, we muſt tranſport theſe meaſures upon the baſe, as are B B B, equal to A A A, to draw them to the point of diſtance C, and to take notice where they ſhall divide the Ray D E, at the points F, and from theſe points to raiſe Perpendiculars which ſhall be the aſcents of the windows in the Return.</p>

Then from the midſt of the wall Y, to draw to the point of ſight, for to divide thoſe Parallels at the point Z, and from theſe points to elevate the Balls; for to give the height to theſe Balls, we muſt know wherewith we would cover them, and according to that to give them the Meaſure that we have ſpoken of, ſuppoſing that it be of Slates; we muſt of the bredth of the wall make a Triangle equilateral 1, 2, 3. And from the point 3 to draw to the point of ſight, and to divide the Ball at the point 4. At which point 4 we muſt draw lines from the corners of the Houſe, which will give the ſhape to the Pavillion</p>
               <p>For the Roofs with Pinions there is not ſo much to order, we muſt only of the bredth of the wall 5, 6, make a Triangle equilateral 5, 6, 7. and as much on the other end of the wall, which ſhall give the point 8.

               <p>IN the figure aforegoing, we have ſet the Roofs with ſmall Pinacles view'd in front, to which we muſt give the Triangle equilateral for their height, when we do make them of ſlate: If they make them of other things, as of Tile or Thatch we muſt take their meaſures at the little figure below.</p>
               <p>For to ſet this faſhion of Roofs in return we muſt ſet upon the baſe from the foundation of the houſe, the breadth that it hath as is A B; and of this breadth to frame a Triangle according to the height that we would give to the Roof, as to this, which hath a Triangle equilate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, whereof C D, is the height which muſt be ſet Perpendicularly at the firſt corner of the houſe, at the whole height of the Wall as is E F. Then to take the breadth of the houſe C, which is the midſt of A B, and to draw it to the diſtance, and where it ſhall divide the Ray A, at the point G, to raiſe a Perpendicule; then you muſt from the point F draw to the point of ſight X, and the ſection that ſhall be made of the Perpendicule H, ſhall be the point of the Pinacle, to which you muſt draw from the corners of the houſe E I, if one would have there any advancings, he may ſet them there at his pleaſure as we may ſee on the other ſide K.</p>
               <p>For the ſloping we muſt only prolong the line where one would ſet the top of the Roof, as is here the line L M, and to give it ſuch a bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as we would. To this, there is as much of the height M N, as the houſe hath of breadth N O, if from the points M O, we draw to the point of ſight X, we ſhall divide the Perpendicule of the Hollow at the point P Q. which we muſt joyn with a right line, which ſhall finiſh the framing of the Roof. The figures of the other ſide make the houſe covered to be ſeen after theſe faſhions.</p>

But to avoid the trouble to run back to the one, and to the other: I will ſay, that for to make theſe buildings, we muſt always ſet the meaſures upon the baſe, and draw them to the point of diſtance; and at their ſections to raiſe Perpendiculars, and the firſt Angle ſhall ſerve for the line of elevation: For example, this body of an houſe hath for his breadth A B, and for its length B C, which is the double of its breadth A B, from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the meaſures of the doors and the windows they muſt be ſet upon the baſe between the letters A B, and B C, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from all theſe points to the points of diſtances D E, we muſt take notice, where the B D, or B E, ſhall be divided, for to elevate there the aſcents of the windows. The Perpendicule of the firſt Angle B, muſt ſerve for the line of elevation, which ſhall give the Travers and height of the windows, all the reſt is intelligible enough.</p>
               <p>For the figure below it is the ſame order, with that of the Chairs without order which is, that having made the plane Geometrical, we muſt ſet it into Perſpective, as the irregular pieces. Then to ſet the Rule at every bending of the plane, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve where the Horizon ſhall be divided, for to make a point there, to which we muſt draw, as if it were the point of ſight of each ſide of the building, each ſide having its particular point: For example, the plane being ſet in Perſpective, the ſide H I, giveth upon the Horizon the point K, to which we muſt draw all the Rays of this ſide: The other ſide I L, muſt alſo have its point within the Horizon, but our paper is too ſhort for to make it be ſeen. Theſe 2 points being found, we muſt place there the Rule, and make an occult line to paſs by the other ſide of the building parallel upon the plane to that which hath given the point within the Horizon; and to continue it unto the baſe, as from the point K by the corner L, unto M; and by the corner H, unto N. Then to ſet between N I, the number of the windows which muſt be on the ſide H I, and between I, and M, to ſet the meaſures of them that we would have on the ſide I L: All theſe meaſures being upon the baſe, we muſt draw them to the points that we have found, and do altogether the ſame, as in the figure above.</p>

               <p>If one would have but one Rank of Trees on each ſide of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective, there will be no need to make a plane of little ſquares, he may only do, as I have ſaid in the fourth advice Fol. 17.</p>
               <p>But when one would make a company of Alleys to appear, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to me, that he ſh ll do very well to frame with occult lines a pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of little ſquares with the Oaks; even as it hath been taught in the planes Fol. 31. And from the Diagonal of little ſquares to raiſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicules, as one may ſee A B; If one deſire the Trees to be farther of, or nearer the one to the other, he muſt encreaſe or diminiſh upon the baſe the diſtances of the ſquares.</p>
               <p>When one ſhall have given ſuch height as he would to the trunk of the firſt Tree, as is A C, from the point C, he muſt draw to the point of ſight D, to the end that all the Trunks of the other Trees may not paſs the Ray C D, the firſt Tree A B, maketh it to be ſeen, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 2 right lines one may give to the Trees ſuch compaſs as he ſhall find good, and that they ought not to be drawn by the Rule.</p>
               <p>The figure below is ordered as that above, there is no difference, but only that above giveth the ſquares Right, or in Front, and this giveth them view'd by the Angle, that is to ſay, that from the meaſures upon the baſe we muſt always draw to the points of diſtances E F, and from the little ſquares to raiſe Perpendicules, and to do the reſt as we have ſaid heretofore.</p>
               <p>One may within the ſame Perſpective, where ſome Alleys ſhould be drawn to the points of diſtances, ſet alſo thoſe that ſhould draw to the point of ſight; as one may ſee by this of the midſt, which draweth to the point G, which is the point of ſight, and the others draw to the points E F, which are the points of diſtances.</p>

He that would make ſome Compartment within the ſquares of the Garden, he muſt uſe the little ſquares of each ſquare, dividing them, and giving them ſuch a figure as he would have, ſo as we may ſee the little ſquare A B: and on the other ſide D E: the hedge-Rows and Arbors are placed oppoſite to each other, and of the bredth of the Alleys.</p>

               <p>THere is not ſo excellent a Maſter, which hath not ſome deſign in ſuch pieces, as he would willingly attain to: If this be ordinary almoſt in all ſciences, it is neceſſary in this, more then in any other, by the great ſubſtitution of points and of lines, which we muſt therein exactly obſerve, and without which nothing can be done, which may content thoſe that have any underſtanding therein.</p>
               <p>Seeing that one is obliged in ſome manner, to make deſigns, we muſt ſearch out that which may help to make them exactly, that may be poſſible: and as every one knoweth that all the length of theſe works, is to draw lines parallel, and Perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, having then ſearched the Invention, as well by experience, as in the Authours, to be able to make them readily: I have found nothing which can help us in that, but the board and the ſquare, which <hi>Viator</hi> hath left us in his Works. All thoſe that would paſs the time in deſigning, ought to have one from the which they ſhall draw the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and benefit which experience will make them to underſtand.</p>
               <p>Although that the Figure giveth ſufficient underſtanding, how it ought to be, and the manner of uſing it, I did believe that I ought to give a more clear underſtanding thereof. This Plank or Board A B C D, ought to be perfectly by the rule or ſquare, of a Foot and half long, of fifteen inches broad, and half an inch thick, that the Wood be good, very dry, and well united, one may paſt a ſheet of Paper on it, for to make it more ſmooth and to help the Pen. The ſquare E F, is a Rule of a foot and half long, as the board, an inch broad, and of thickneſs 2 lines, which is helved at the right Angle within another frame of a Rule G H, eight inches long, one inch broad, and three quarters of an inch thick; for to draw lines, they hold this latter Rule G H, cloſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the board A B C D, and the other Rule E F is aſſuredly ſtrait, if ſo be the board and the Rule be well ordered.</p>
               <p>When one would work, we muſt faſten the leaf of Paper I K L M upon the board, with 4 little bits of Wax N O P Q, and then from one only point, you may draw lines, with aſſuredneſs that they will be right.

               <p>For my part I find that this eaſeth exceedingly, and that without this invention, you muſt always have the hand at the Compaſs. There is no further need of ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but for the viſual Rays, and there are alſo thoſe that uſe a Rule pierced at one end, which they faſten with a Needle to the point of ſight, but this is too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling, I would not counſel any to uſe it, one may as ſoon do it with the common Rule, and ſo is not in danger to ſpoil any thing.</p>

               <p>SEeing that deſigns are made in ſmall, with more facility then in great, it is credible that they will be made therein always, the which hath made me reſolve to give the Method of ſetting ſmall deſigns into great upon Cloth.</p>
               <p>The Painters uſe ordinarily Squares or Checquers, that is to ſay, that they divide the ſmall deſignes and the clothes, where they muſt be painted into the ſame number of ſquares, and ſet proportionally; that which is within one ſquare of the deſign, into the ſquare of the Cloth which anſwereth to it; ſome do like well of this Order.</p>
               <p>But here is another, which in my judgement, is more eaſie, more facile, and more aſſured; we muſt have a skale proportionate to the leſs deſign, and another skale proportionate to the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. When one would make a deſign, the firſt thing that he reſolveth on, is the skale which muſt give all the Meaſures of all the other pieces of the deſign. For example, in the leſs deſign A, the skale B C, of five little parts, (which one may take for feet Royal) hath been made the firſt upon this skale; they have taken the Horizon, the height and diſtance of the Trees, the bredth of the Alleys, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For to fet this ſmall into great, obſerve how we muſt proceed. Firſt, we muſt know, if the Perſpective muſt have the natural Horizon, that is to ſay, that the bottom of the Picture being on the Ground, the Horizontal line be at the height of our eye, which is about five feet Royal; This being, there muſt be five little parts which are between B C, to make a skale of five feet Royal F G, that having taken all the Meaſures at the little one, we may tranſport them, and take upon the great one, as I am about to ſay.</p>
               <p>The two Meaſures of Proportion or skales, being ordered, as I have now ſaid; the firſt thing that one doth, is to take upon the leſſer deſign with a pair of Compaſſes; the diſtance of the baſe D unto the Horizon E, and to carry this opening of the Compaſs D E, upon the leſſer skale B C, and to take notice what number of Parts it ſhall give, as he doth give 5, we muſt then take as many parts upon the great skale F G, and ſet them on the one part and other of the Picture, or great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, beginning at the bottom of the Cloth H H, and they ſhall end in I I, from theſe points I I we muſt draw a Packthread whited or blacked, this line I I ſhall mark the Horizon in the great Picture; Then to take the diſtance or ſinking K L, of the leſſer deſign, which is the foot of the Houſe; and to carry it upon the leſſer skale R C, for to ſee how many parts we ſhall have, and to take the ſame number upon the great skale F G, and to ſet that which we ſhall finde upon the edge of the Cloth H M, H M, which we muſt tringle about, as the Horizon for to have the ſinking of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Tree; In the leſs deſign, we muſt take the diſtance N O, and carry it upon the leſſer skale B C, and take as many parts upon the great ſcale F G, as we ſhall have found in the leſs. N O giveth two parts of the leſſer, we muſt take two of the great one, which will give H P, which we muſt tringle, as we have ſaid: We ſhall uſe in like manner all the Parallels to the baſe, as are the other Trees, the Windows, the Roofs of the Houſes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For the Plumb lines or Perpendiculars to the baſe, it is the ſame Method, there is nothing but to change the ſide for to mark them, which is, that in ſtead of marking on the ſide of the Cloth, as we have done, we muſt mark above and below. For example, for to have the two Cotners of the houſe at bottom; we muſt take with the Compaſſes upon the leſſer deſign Q R, and carry this opening upon the ſcale B C, we ſhall finde about 7 parts and an half; we ſhall take as many parts upon the great ſcale F G, which ſhall give H S T S, which we muſt tringle and do ſo with all the other Perpendiculars, whether building Trees, Hedge-Rows, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>For to finde the viſual Rays, which are the lines that go to the point of ſight V: at this point V we muſt faſten a pack-thread or thread, with a pin bended, for fear of making the hole too great, this thread or pack-thread muſt be of the length of the Picture, for to be able to tringle and draw all the Rays very exactly; For example, for to have the two Rays of the bredth of the Trees, which are in the leſs deſign D X, we muſt take this deſign D X, and to carry it upon the leſser ſcale B C, and to take upon the great F G, in proportion to that which we ſhall have found in the leſs which will give H Y, the which points H Y we ſhall tringle with the Pack-thread of the point V; for to have alſo the Ray of Hedge-Rows, we muſt take the diffance D Z, and carry it upon the ſcale B C, and take as many parts upon the great ſcale F G, which will give H I, which we muſt tringle with the pack-thread from the point V, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>AS all thoſe for whom I labour, have not perhaps a ſufficient ground for to be clear into this order, or Univerſal manner; I believed that the Author would permit me to make it eaſie to them, as much as I ſhall be able, that they may draw benefit thereby. Wherefore I ſhall ſet theſe two figures, which will cauſe to remember that which I have already ſaid, in the 2. 3. 4. and 5. advice, which are for the underſtanding of this order, there having ſhewed to take all the meaſures upon the baſe, and that as many Rays as d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vide the Diagonal C, are as many ſmall ſquares in the ſinking of the picture, to which ſquares they give ſuch a greatneſs as they will.</p>
               <p>That we may not go to ſeek ſo far, let us look on the firſt figure where the baſe is A B, the point of ſight G, the points of diſtances E F, I divide this baſe into 12 equal parts; each of which I ſhall make to be about a foot, and from all theſe diviſions, I ſhall draw to the point of ſight, which ſhall be as many Rays, whereof A and B are the laſt. Now I ſay that he that would have a line, which ſhould appear ſunk a foot in the Picture, that he muſt draw from the firſt diviſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> D to the point of diſtance F, and where this line D F, ſhall divide the Ray E G, that ſhall be the point for to draw the line ſunk a foot in the picture, if we would have one of 3 feet ſinking, we muſt take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the baſe 3 of theſe parts, and from the third to draw alſo to the diſtance F; and we ſhall have at the ſection of the Ray B G; the place for to draw this line. So that if from the point C, we draw to the point F, where this line C F, ſhall divide B G, this ſhall be a line ſunk of 6 feet,</p>
               <p>If of the other 6 parts that remain A C, we make 24, dividing each into 4, and that we leave not to make each part to avail a foot, there will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>4 feet from A. to C. In ſuch manner as if we require a line; which ſhould appear ſunk 18 feet in the Picture, I ſhould reckon from A, 18 little parts, and from the 18 I would draw to the diſtance E, which would give me by the ſection of the Ray A C, the point for to draw this line; if one would that it ſhould be ſunk 24 feet, we muſt take A C, and draw from C, to E, and where this line ſhould divide A G, at the point H, we ſhall draw H I, which will appear of 24 feet of ſinking in the picture.</p>
               <p>According to the Perſpective, this line H I, is equal to that A G, and containeth as many feet or parts, ſo that if one draw from the point I, to the point E, the ſection of this line I E, at the Ray A G, ſhall be for to draw a line K L ſunk of 48 feet; If from this we draw further to the diſtance E, we ſhall have the ſection of the Ray A G, yet a line removed 24 feet more then the others. And if one would have a line ſunk 30 feet, we muſt from the point A, reckon 6 ſmall parts, and from the ſixth draw to the point of ſight G, and take notice where we ſhall divide the line H I, as here at the point M. Then from the point M, to draw to the diſtance E, and this line M E, ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the Ray A G, where we muſt draw this line N, if it were of 40. We ſhould from A, reckon 16, and do all the ſame if, it were 60, we ſhould from A, reckon 12, and from 12, draw to the point of ſight G, unto the line K L, which ſhould be the point O, Then from O; to draw to the diſtance E, and from the ſection of the Ray A G, ſhall be for to draw this line.</p>
               <div type="subpart">
                  <head>For the ſecond figure.</head>
                  <p>BY that which I have ſpoken, it is eaſie to find a point for ſuch a ſinking as one would have. There remaineth to ſhew how we may find it within, or without the Ray A G, or B C, for this the line B C, ſhall ſerve as a ſcale of ſix feet, the one of which I ſhall divide into twelve inches, that I may there find the half, the third, and the 4th of a foot. All being thus ordered. If one require of me a point which appeareth of 17 feet long, and of a foot and half within the Ray A G. I will draw from the 17th part of the baſe to the point of diſtance E, and where the Ray A G, ſhall be divided in P, I will draw a line P Q, now when one requireth a foot and half within the Ray A G, I will take with a Compaſs upon the ſame line P Q, but on the ſide B C, a foot 6 inches, which I will car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from P, unto R. And this point R, ſhall be the point which hath been demanded.</p>
                  <p>And if one would have one yet at 29 feet diſtance within the Picture, and ſeven and an half be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Ray A G. We muſt draw from C, to the point E. and where it ſhall divide A G, to draw a line which ſhall be of 24 feet, then from A. taking five little parts, to draw them to the point of ſight G, until that we divide this line at the point S, and from this point S, to draw to the d ſtance E Where the Ray A G ſhall be divided, we muſt draw a line T V, ſeeing they require 7 feet and an half beyond the Ray A, we muſt upon the ſame line T V, but on the ſide B C, take 7 parts and 6 inches with a Compa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>For to give juſtly the diſtance removed, the Point remaining in the Picture,</head>
               <p>THoſe that would uſe this common manner muſt know, that the number of feet that we ſhall take upon the baſe, ought to have reſpect to the diſtance that they ſhall have determined of.</p>
               <p>For to cauſe my Propoſition to be underſtood, I will ſet in the firſt figure two diſtances, the one of ſix feet, the other of twelve, which have reſpect the one to the other, by reaſon that dividing into two each of the ſix parts, we ſhall have twelve.</p>
               <p>Let us ſuppoſe then that the line A B is divided into twelve parts, and that from all theſe parts, one hath drawn Rays to the point of ſight C, let us take now the half of theſe diviſions A D, and draw to the point E, which is the diſtance of 6 feet; it is certain that the ſection of the Ray A C, ſhall be the abridgement of the ſquares view'd ſix feet diſtant. If from the point D we draw to the point F, which is the diſtance of twelve feet, this line D F dividing the Ray A C, ſhall give the abridgement of ſix little ſquares view'd twelve feet diſtance. He that would have the abridgement of twelve ſquares, view'd twelve feet diſtant, he muſt from the point B, which is the whole baſe, draw to the point F; and at the ſection of the Ray A C to the point H, ſhall be that which is required: or elſe from the point I to draw I F, which ſhall give the ſame point H, and the line H K ſhall be ſunk twelve little ſquares viewed at 12 feet diſtance. We ſee in this that 12 little ſquares viewed at 12 feet diſtance, do meet in the ſame line H K, that ſix ſquares viewed at ſix feet diſtance, and all the lines of ſix ſquares, that the ſection of the Diagonal D G hath given, do reflect themſelves by two and two to thoſe, which the Diagonal D F hath given, the reaſon why the Diagonal D F hath given two lines for one of thoſe D G, is that the diſtance is doubled. If it were trebled it would give three, and four if it were four-fold. Now for to finde on the ſide B D, the ſame ſections, and the ſame number of little ſquares, as on the ſide D A, without the point of diſtance be out of the picture, we muſt only di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide into two each of the ſix equal parts which are between B D, which will make 12 parts, and from their diviſions to draw occult lines to the point of ſight C; and if one draw Parallels to the baſe, by all the ſections that the Diagonal maketh of all theſe Rays he ſhall have 12 ſquares of ſinking in the ſame line, and if the diſtance were of twelve feet, although that G be but ſix feet of diſtance: the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this is, that by multiplying the Rays we multiply the ſquares, and multiplying the ſquares we remove the diſtance: ſee then how having made twelve parts of ſix, which were between B D, there ariſeth twelve little ſquares, which make the ſame ſinking that the diſtance at twelve feet diſtant. And he that would have the diſtance at 24 feet, he muſt divide ſtill into two, each of the parts between B D, which would make 24 parts, and from the 24th. to the point D, to draw the line D G the ſection that it would make of the Ray B C at the point K, would be the ſinking of the 24 feet.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond figure, I have ſet upon the line L M the ſame Meaſures as upon A B of the firſt figure, and on the ſide M N, the ſame ſinking, and the ſame diſtance as on the ſide A D, which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the line H K, to the end that we may ſee, that he which would draw the fifth part, as Q G, or from the ſeventh as R G, that he ſhould not have the true ſinking which is at K: for R G would not ſink enough, and Q G would ſink too much, although from theſe 5 or 7 parts, there would be made twelve or twenty four.</p>
               <p>Wherefore we muſt obſerve to take always a Number, which may be multiplied by the diſtance, as here the diſtance of ſix may ſerve for 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48. and ſo an infinite number by ſix. The diſtance of 5 may ſerve for 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, &amp;c. The diſtance of eight, may ſerve for 16, 24, 32, 40. 48, &amp;c. We cannot fail doing thus, for ſuppoſing that the point of diſtance could not be nearer to the point of ſight then G is near to C, it follOweth that if G is at 6, at 7, 8, or at 10 feet from the point C, that the half of the baſe hath the ſame number, the which number we muſt divide proportionably to the removal, which we will give it. For example, if there be eight feet from N to L, and that I would have the diſtance of 32 feet without that G go out from his place, I will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide each of the eight parts, which is the half of the baſe as L N into 4, and 4 times 8 will be 32 Rays, ſo the abridgements of the ſquare ſhould be at 32 feet of diſtance.</p>
               <p>All theſe little diviſions remain not after the Picture is made, there are none but the principal diviſions of feet, which they draw to the point of ſight, and the abridgements, that is to ſay, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel to the baſe which remain always.</p>

               <head>A very ſine Invention, for to make naturally Perſpectives without keeping the Rules.</head>
               <p>HAving ſet down all the Rules, that we muſt keep for to make exactly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectives: I would ſet alſo this Invention, and the following, for to make thereby perfectly fair ones and very exact without being obliged for to uſe any one rule therefore</p>
               <p>This ſhall ſerve for thoſe that love Panting, and take the pleaſure to uſe it; without being willing to take the pains to open the Compaſs, nor to take the Rule for to draw a line; for in this order, we ſhall not need neither the one nor the other. And never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs we may make very fair Perſpectives, either of Buildings, of Gardens, or Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skips. Before we proceed to the order, we muſt know, that the principal piece and neceſſary for this invention, is a great leaſe of Glaſs very clear, encloſed in a frame of Wood well ſmooth'd and thin, which I have marked with A: at the bottom of the figure, this frame muſt ſlide between two pieces of Wood, an Inch and an half thick, the which muſt be faſtned to the end of a board, which is of the breadth of the Frame, as B C ſheweth, fit for to receive the Frame A. The breadth of this board B D, ſhall be of a foot C. At the midſt of the fore-part of this board, we muſt make one or more ſquare holes E, for to faſten there a little Iron Rod or Wire, as a Rule pierced all along, whereby to raiſe it, or let it down at the top of this Rule F, there ſhall be Round of 3 or 4 Inches of Diameter, without thickneſs, as it might be of white Lattin, the which muſt have a little hole in the midſt, as it were for a piece to go through, all theſe things put into one, make the piece G</p>
               <p>Although the figure ſheweth the order, and how we muſt uſe this piece G, yet I will not ceaſe to tell, how we muſt proceed therein. Having then placed this piece G, before that which one would draw, he ſhall look through the little hole of the ſpectacle F, if one can diſcover upon the Glaſs all that he would that ſhould be there: if any thing come not there, you muſt put the ſpectacle nearer to the Glaſs; until that he do ſee there, that which he deſireth The piece being ſo ſetled, we muſt mark upon the Glaſs, all that ſhall be ſeen there, looking through the hole F, which doth here, that which the point of ſight doth in other Orders, it being moſt certain, that all that ſhall be marked upon the leaf of Glaſs, having the eye at the little hole of the ſpectacle ſhall be found perfectly in the Rules of the Perſpective.</p>
               <p>Every one knoweth how we muſt withdraw that which ſhall be deſigned; wherefore I ſhall leave that, for to ſay that one may mark upon the Glaſs with the Pen and Ink. and after that all is done, to moiſten a little the other ſide of the Glaſs for to refreſh the Ink and to ſet on the ſide, which we ſhall have traced, a Paper ſomewhat moiſt, and then to paſs the hand upon it; and the Paper will take, all that which was marked upon the Glaſs.</p>
               <p>If one will, they may alſo uſe a Penſil, and colours according as every one ſhall think good, it is enough that one know the invention to uſe it, for to retract that which they will: For it is as eaſie to retract a Pallace as a Countrey-Houſe, or a Chamber, ſeeing that it is nothing but to ſet ones ſelf in a place, where there may ſee that which they would deſign, and to bring the ſpectacle near the Glaſs, when there ſhall be ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d, by the means of holes, which are in the Board.</p>
               <p>A Painter may alſo uſe this for to retract figures, at ſuch a poſture, as he ſhall have given them, for to retract after the emboſſing. In a word, for all that he ſhall judge, be aſſured, that the uſe will render many things eaſie that were hard before.</p>

               <head>Another pretty Invention for to exerciſe the Perſpective, without knowing it.</head>
               <p>THis Invention is found to be as pretty, as the former, and ſome do eſteem it more; by reaſon that the other obligeth to deſign twice: the firſt upon the Glaſs: the ſecond to retract that which one hath done there: and in this, we deſign but once, and as exactly as the other.</p>
               <p>I will not ſet down the framing of this inſtrument, it having no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from that which I have now given, but only that inſtead of a leaf of Glaſs, we muſt ſet there a frame, divided by little ſquares, with threads very ſlender, as the figure ſheweth it, the which I ſhall call a Lettice; for the number of the ſquares, I leave that to the diſcretion of every one, I ſhall ſay only that we muſt not make them too great, for to work more exactly, nor too little for fear of being confuſed.</p>
               <p>For the order, there is need, that this piece H, be placed in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that one may ſee by the hole of the ſpectacle I, all that we would deſign; if the deſign, which we deſire to make, muſt be greater then the frame, or then the Lettice is, or as others will, the Checker-board, we muſt make the ſquares of linnen-Cloth or of Paper, greater then that of the frame, and if it be leſſer, we muſt make the ſquares leſſer, but we muſt always make ſquares for to carry in each ſquare of its pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or of the Cloth, that which we ſhall ſee within the ſquares of the frame, looking upon it by the ſpectacle I, and if all ſhall be repreſented proportionably, the deſign will be as juſt for the Perſpective, as if one had uſed Rules and the Compaſs.</p>
               <p>I have ſet the two figures, for to cauſe to be ſeen how this piece H, muſt be placed for to uſe it in deſigning upon a Table, and when one would paint, by the one and the other manner, we may make more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly all ſorts of Perſpectives, counterfeit Pictures, and draw to the life.</p>
               <p>I doubt not but many will ſay, that this method is not new, and that there is not a Painter, that knoweth not how to enlarge and diminiſh Pictures, uſing this Checker-board, that is true, but I beleive that not any one hath ever uſed the ſpectacle, which is the ſecret for to make every thing in its perfection.</p>

               <p>AFter that we have ſet down that which may ſerve for to make all ſorts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectives, with the means to give them a pleaſing and ornaments for to content the eye, there remaineth no more but to find out a way for to deceive it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, which is to ſet down the figures there.</p>
               <p>But before we paſs any further, we muſt make a diſtinction of figures, for it is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to repreſent a Hiſtory, then to intend to deceive the eye in a peice, which ſhall be ſet at the bottom of a Gallery, of a Hall, or of an Alley in a Garden, for to theſe all figures of repoſe or reſting are the beſt, and for a Hiſtory, they muſt be all lively and ſpirited, by the diverſity of their poſture.</p>
               <p>The multitude of Horizons, which the Painters take in their Pictures, is the cauſe that they make an infinite company of Faults there, by not knowing to give the height that they ought to the figures, proportionable to their Horizon, I will give them a Rule, that they may not fail there, whatſoever Horizon they ſhall have.</p>

               <p>IN the Perſpectives, which are ſet at the end of a Gallery, of an Alley, of an Hall; or of any other place for to deceive the ſight, we muſt always ſet the Horizon at the natural height, that is to ſay; at 5 Feet Royal, which are the height of the common ſize.</p>
               <p>He that would ſet there figures for to appear in the natural, they ought to have the eye within the Horizon: for if the Figures have the eyes within the Horizon as we have, they will appear to us of our height, this ought to ſuffice for the inſtruction, but for to be more clear, and to make my ſelf better underſtood, I ſhall make uſe of theſe three figures inſtead of many others, which one may ſet there, if he will. The firſt Figure A, ſhall have the natural height, and the eyes within the Horizon, if I ſhould yet have ano h r Figure at the place B, I muſt from the point B, raiſe a line unto the Horizon, and that ſhall appear of the ſame height with the firſt. He that would have a third at C let him always ſet the eyes thereof within the Horizon, it ſhall be of the height of the others within the appearance: In ſhort, although there ſhould be a thouſand, there is no other Rule to be kept when the Horizon is at the natural height. I intend not to ſpeak of Children, which oughr to be made in proportion to the great figures, and according to the diſcretion of the Painters.</p>

               <p>WHen Pictures are made for Halls; where ordinarily they hang them, and place them ſomwhat high, we muſt take the Horizon lower, for to approach to the eye, as far as ſhall be poſſible.</p>
               <p>Now for to give juſtly, and with proportion, the height to each Figures, in what place ſoever, we meet with them, we muſt make one at what height we would, in ſome place of the picture, as is the figure D E, which is here that which we have cal'd the line of elevation in the proceeding orders.</p>
               <p>For to find the height of other Figures, which one would ſet into this picture, which ſhould appear as high as the firſt D E, we muſt from the Feet of this F, and from the top of its head D, draw lines where we will within the Horizon, as is the point E, and between this Triangle D E F, ſhall be found all the heights of the others: For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, if I would find the height that the Figure muſt have of the point G, from this point G, I draw a parallel to the baſe G H, untill that it divide the line F E, which ſhall be at the point H, from which I raiſe a Perpendicule, until that it divide the line, or Ray D E at the point I, and this Perpendicule H I is the height of the Figure, which we muſt take with a Compaſs for to carry it to the point G, if I would have another at the point K, I have only to make the ſame operations, and I ſhall have the Perpendicule M N, for its height, and ſo of as many as one will.</p>

And for this of the Horizon high, all the Figures raiſe themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the firſt, and the furtheſt diſtant is always the moſt elevated, but nevertheleſs the leſſer in proportion, and according to the meaſure, which one ſhall take thus. Having made the firſt figure A B, we muſt from the top of its head, and from under its feet, draw in what place one would of the Horizon, which is here the point C; all the heights of the other Figures muſt be taken between this Triangle A C B. For ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, deſirous to have the height of the Figure from the point D, from this point D we muſt make a Parallel to the baſe D E, unto the line A C, which ſhall be the point E, from which we muſt raiſe a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular unto the line B C, which ſhall give the point F this Perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular E F ſhall be the height which muſt be to the figure from the point D. If at the point G we would have yet a figure, you muſt make the ſame practiſe from the Point D, and you ſhall have the Perpendicule H I, which ſhall be for the height of the figure from the point G, And by the ſame Method all the other figures ſhall take the heights from what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever place it be.</p>

               <p>For example, the figure A which is above the Mountain, hath for its height five feet Royal, which is the natural. I ſuppoſe, that the Mountain hath twenty five feet of height, if one be raiſed up twenty feet, as this Piece in the midſt whither the Beholder is raiſed, which ought alſo to have five feet for his height, the Horizon will meet it at twenty five feet, as the Top of the Mountain and the Horizon will grate upon it, as we ſee at the Figure of the Mountain, which hath the feet upon the Horizon.</p>
               <p>Now for to finde the height of theſe little perſons which are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the field, we muſt make a figure twenty five feet lower, under that of A, or in ſome other place, as is B C. And from the feet B, and from the head C, to draw in ſome place within the Horizon, as is the point O, and between theſe two lines B and C, which go to the point O, we muſt take the height of the little figures, as we have done in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders aforegoing, as for to have the height of the little figure D. We muſt draw a Parallel to the baſe; until that it divide the line B at the point E, from which we ſhall raiſe the Perpendicule, which ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the line C O at the point F.</p>
               <p>And we muſt take with a Compaſs this Perpendicule E F, for the height of the figure from the point D: If one would have alſo the height of the figures from the points G H, we muſt do the ſame as at the Figure D, and we ſhall finde their height between the lines B and C, which we muſt take with a Compaſs, and tranſport them to the points G H, and do always the ſame for as many perſons as you would diminiſh I all unto one point,</p>
               <p>Obſerve here all that may be ſaid for the Meaſures of Figures, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Perſpective. But ſeeing that I am engaged for all the Meaſures of figures, I have ſet down all the Orders following, although they are not according to this Art.</p>

               <head>For to give the natural height, or ſuch as one would to Figures elevated on high.</head>
               <p>THAT we may omit nothing for the heights of Figures, we will ſet down alſo the two Rules following, whereof one hath already been given by <hi>Albert Durer, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio,</hi> and others, for to write letters in an eminent place, and to make them appear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to thoſe below: by the ſame reaſon we may make uſe of it for to finde the Meaſures and the greatneſs of Figures, which ſhall appear all equal from a certain point where the Beholder ſhall be.</p>
               <p>There is a man at the point B, five feet high, and diſtant from the Tower A fifty feet, which beholdeth the firſt Figure C, which appeareth to him as natural, and at 30 feet higher D he would ſet another Figure, which ſhould appear as natural as the other from the place where he is: How ſhould he finde its meaſure?</p>
               <p>He muſt make a quarter of a Round, or only a little Arch upon the paper, which he muſt ſet before the Eye, and behold the feet and the head of the Figure C, and that ſhall give to the quarter of the Circle, the diſtance or the Angle E F, then he muſt at the ſame time, and without moving the quarter of the Circle, behold the point D, where ought to be the foot of the Figure D I, and to mark the point that it ſhall give at the quarter of the Circle, which is here the point G; and at this point G he muſt ſet the Angle, or the ſame diſtance that the Figure C ſhall have given, which is E F, which being tranſported unto G, ſhall give G H. Then by the point H, we muſt look where we ſhall divide the line elevated from D, which ſhall be at the point I, ſo that the diſtance D I ſhall be the height which we muſt give to the Figure which we would ſet there. He that would make one yet higher, hath only to do the ſame operations, and he ſhall have that which he deſireth, and they ſhall all appear as natural to the Beholder B. If one would know the reaſon, he muſt remember the Principles, or to look therein anew, and he ſhall finde that all the Objects view'd under equal Angles appear equal; now it is that the Angle G H is equal to E F, whereof the Figure D I muſt appear in the eye equal to the figure C</p>

            <div type="section">
               <head>For to know how much Figures equal diminiſh to the eye, the one ſet vpon the others in height.</head>
               <p>THE Beholders K, having a quarter of a Round, or part of a Circle, as that of the firſt figure B, he looketh upon the firſt figure M, from the Tower L, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to him as Natural, meaſuring it from the feet unto the head; he marketh the Angle, or the diſtance upon his quarter of a Circle, which are N O; then without ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any thing, he beholdeth alſo the feet and the head of the Figure P, and marketh upon his quarter of the Round the Angle that it giveth, which is Q R, if there were any alſo higher, he could take them all, and ſet them upon his quarter of a Round.</p>
               <p>For to know the difference that there is from the one to the other, we muſt with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs take the Angles, or the diſtances of the one and of the other, and we ſhall know that the moſt elevated give the leaſt Angle, and by conſequence make appear to the eye the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures leſſer; and then we may ſay, that the figure P appeareth not to the eye, but the half of the figure M, although that one be as high as that other. If one demand the reaſon, we ſhall ſay that the figure P giveth to the quarter of the Round of an Angle, which is but the half of the figure M, as one may ſee that Q R is but the half of N O, or very little to ſpeak of. By this knowledge we come to the other from above, and from that from above, to this here: for if M and P be of the ſame height, and that P from below appear not but the half of M; we may ſay aſſuredly, that to make P to be ſeen as M, that there would need yet as much more of height, the ſame is of that above, where the figure D, which is double of C, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not at all greater, beholding it from the point B<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> One may ſay alſo, that if D were not greater then C, there would appear but the half of its height, and ſo one Rule is the Reverſe of the other.</p>
               <p>As well the firſt as the ſecond Order ought to be contracted, as the figures are made heretofore, where we ſhall have alſo aſſuredly the diff rence and proportion of the figures, as if they were taken at the Natural with this fourth of the Circle.</p>

               <head>Of Meaſures for the Figures elevated.</head>
               <p>COncerning that which we are ſpeaking of, for the diminution of figures when they are eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, we muſt draw the Meaſures in proportion to thoſe which we would elevate in the Pictures, whether we do ſet them upon the Mountains, upon the Houſes, or upon the Clouds in the Air. The two Orders that we are about to give, ſhall render the Method very eaſie.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, I ſuppoſe that the man A is ſix feet high, the which height we multiply many times upon a plumb line B upon the baſe; and from theſe diviſions from 6 to ſix feet, we muſt draw to the Head of the Figure A; Then having ſet a leg of the Compaſs at the point A, with the other leg we muſt make the Arch C D, and the ſections which this Arch ſhall make of the Rays, ſhall be the Meaſures which we muſt give to the Figures, for example, if one would make a figure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare Elevated 42 feet we muſt take the draught E D, which divideth the 2 laſt Rays, which we muſt tranſport to F, which is elevated 42 feet upon the ſame baſe A B. If we would have another at 30 feet high, we muſt take the draught G H, which divideth the Rays 30 and 36, which ſhall be the height of the Figure P, and ſo of others. All the concernment is to know how much this line B ought to approach or retire back, which ought always to be the diſtance of the beholder to the Object beheld, as here of 30 feet, or thereabouts.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond Order, in ſtead of this line B, in the firſt Order I have ſet the diviſions from 6 to 6 feet upon the baſe I T, the two firſt points I and 6 ought to be drawn to the point of ſight K, for to have between theſe two Rays I K, 6 K, the Meaſure of ſix feet, which is the height that we give to the Figures. Then from all theſe other Meaſures from 6 to 6, unto 48 or more, if there be any, we muſt draw to the point of diſtance L, and at the ſections that we ſhall make of the Ray 6 K; we muſt draw little Parallels to the baſe, between the Rays I 6; the which Parallels ſhall be the heights of figures within the ſinking; and by conſequence, for the figures elevated at the ſame diſtanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He that would know how much each figure is diminiſhed from the firſt which hath ſix feet, he hath but only to take the height of that which he deſireth with a Compaſs, and carry the Compaſs ſo open upon the little ſcale M, and he ſhall have that he deſireth. For example, if having taken the height of the figure P we carry it upon the ſcale M, it will give but 4 feet, the which cauſeth to know, that a Figure of 6 feet elevated 30 feet, will appear but of 4 feet. The heights or diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of others ſhall be known by the ſame operations, ſo that it be in the ſame diſtance with theſe here; if one change the diſtance, all the Orders muſt be begun again all anew, and work as we have done.</p>
               <p>The Figures V X Y, which are in the Air above the Clouds, at the ſecond Figure below, are of the ſame height and proportion as that in the firſt: I have ſet them down only for to ſee, that alth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as the laſt N, containeth but twice and an half, of the 6, the I hath, this O which ſhall be upon the Tower, ought to have but 2 and an half of the 6 parts that the figu e N hath. If I would have alſo a Figure R, Elevated upon another Tower of 48 or 50 feet before the figure Q, we muſt take alſo 2 parts and an half of 6, from the Figure Q, for the height of the Figure R. He that would have alſo one in S, at the ſame Tower, which is elevated 30 feet, he muſt give it 4 parts of the 6, of the Figure Q. that is to ſay, 4 feet, as we have found it in the firſt O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>The Original of Shadows.</head>
               <p>FOr to define the natural Shadow, we ſay not that it is an entire Privation of light; for that would be to ſay a perfect obſcurity, where we ſhould ſee as little the objects as their ſhadows, but we underſtand a diminution of Light, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the interpoſition of ſome body which is not tranſparent, the which receiving the Sun, or the clearneſs which ſhould caſt it ſelf upon the plane where it is ſet, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth there a ſhadow of its ſhape, for the light being Comunicative of it ſelf, produceth it ſelf upon all that which is not hidden from it, &amp; Extendeth it ſelf upon all that is plain and united: but if it meet which the leaſt Elevation, this hinderance cauſeth it to make a Shadow, which rendreth upon the Plane the forme and figure of that which is Enlightned.</p>
               <p>The diverſity of lights, maketh a diverſity of ſhadows for if the body that enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth is greater then that which is enlightned the ſhadow will be leſſer then the body if they be equall, the ſhadow will be equall to the Body enlightned: but if the light be leſſer then the Object, the ſhadow will ſtill be more and more the greater.</p>
               <p>For to underſtand this the better, we will make the three figures following, which ſhall ſerve us as a foundation, for the Rules which we ſhall give.</p>
               <p>The firſt ſheweth that the Body of light A B, being much greater then the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned C D, it Enlightneth more then the half of the Object, the which maketh it to give a ſhadow with a Point and frame it into a Pyramide, whereof the Sun is the Baſe. This truth is ſhewed in the Ecliepſe of the Moon, which is ſeldom wholly Covered with the ſhadow of the earth, which nevertheleſs exceedeth it in greatneſs forty times, by reaſon that the Sun, which is the body full of light, is an hundred ſixty ſix times, and more, greater then the Earth, which it enlightneth more then the half; and by conſequencee cauſeth to give a ſhadow to it in a point.</p>
               <p>The ſecond, having the body of light F G, equal in greatneſs to the enlightned H I, it enlightneth the half of the Object, and giveth its ſhadow parallel H I K L.</p>
               <p>The third maketh appear, that the lightſome body, or the light M, being leſs then that which is enlightned N O, is not enlightned by the half, the which cauſeth a ſhadow unto it, N O P Q, which enlargeth it ſelf according as it is removed, from the object, and maketh a Pyramide, whereof the light is the point.</p>

               <head>Of the difference of Shadows.</head>
               <p>BY that which I have ſpoken in the Leaf aforegoing, we muſt conclude, that one and the ſame Object may give divers ſhapes of ſhadows or projections, although that it be enlightned of the ſame ſide; by reaſon that the Sun giveth it of one faſhion, the Torch of another, and the Day doth not frame it.</p>
               <p>The Sun rendreth always the ſhadow equal to the object, that is to ſay, by parallel, as the firſt figure ſheweth it. I ſhall teach in the Leaves following, how we ought to uſe this method, and to give to every object the natural ſhadow, which the Sun would cauſe it to have; All Painters, Gravers and others may, if they pleaſe, obſerve theſe Rules, when they would make any thing pleaſing, and not to take the Rule of the Candle, or Torch, for this; as divers have done.</p>
               <p>The ſhadow of the Torch is not given by parallels, but by Rays, which iſſue from the ſame Center, that which cauſeth the ſhadow is never equal to the body, but more large, and is greater always according as it is removed, the which may be ſeen in the ſecond figure, where the ſhadow is larger then in the firſt, although that the Cubes of the one and the other be of equal breadth and height. See then how one ſhould be much deceived if one ſhould make the ſhadow of a Torch, like as that of the Sun, and of the Sun, as that of the Candle, ſeeing that the difference is ſo notable.</p>
               <p>There is a third ſort of ſhadow, which is neither of the Sun, nor of a Torch, but only cauſed by a fair Day, the which having not ſtrength enough for to frame the figure, rendreth only a confuſed blackneſs at the object, as in the third figure. Now this hath no Rule, wherefore every one giveth it, and practiceth it according to his fancy,</p>
               <p>All theſe ſhadows as well of the Sun, as of the Torch, and of the Day, ought to be more dark then the parts of the objects which are not enlightned, as A, it not ſo dark as B, by reaſon that A receiveth the reflection of the clearneſs, which is about it: and B, hath not the reflection that A, which is in obſcurity. We muſt obſerve alſo, that the part of the ſhadow moſt diſtant from the object, is alſo more dark, then the part nearer as G, is darker then H, by reaſon that A cannot communicate that little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection which it receiveth unto G, as it doth to H.</p>

               <head>For to finde the ſhape of the Shadows.</head>
               <p>WE ſhall obſerve at the beginning of this Book, that the Definition of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective is to give upon a Plane perpendicular to the Horizon, the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Objects which are upon the Ground, or upon a Plane Horizontal: And for ſhadows, it is altogether contrary; ſeeing that one ſuppoſeth a Body elevated upon the Plane, the which being enlightned, caſteth its ſhadow upon the ſame Plane, as we ſee, that the Body A giveth upon the Plane the ſhadow B; for to finde the ſhadows we muſt ſuppoſe two things, the Light and a Body: The Light, although it be contrary to it, it is that nevertheleſs which giveth it its Being, and the Body or the Object giveth it its ſhape and its figure. I ſhall not diſcourſe here but of ſhadows, for I ſuppoſe that we have learned to ſet the Bodies or Objects into Perſpective.</p>
               <p>For to underſtand theſe ſhadows more eaſily, and render the Orders following more eaſie; we muſt mark that we muſt make uſe of two points: the one of the foot of the light, which ought always to be taken upon the Plane where the Object is placed; and the other of the Torch or lightſom Body; ſeeing that the Rule is general for the Sun and for the Torch, with this only difference, that the ſhadow of the Sun is given by Parallel, and that of the Torch by the Ray of the ſame Center. We will begin with that of the Torch, ſeeing that it will help the better to comprehend that of the Sun, which ſhall follow.</p>
               <p>We ſay then for example, That if one would have the ſhadow of the Cube A, as we ſee B, that we muſt from the point O, foot of the light, draw lines by all the Angles of the Plane of the Object, as here by the plane of the Cube O D, O E, O F, O G: Then you muſt draw other lines from the point of the light of the Torch by all the ſame Angles elevated, and to continue theſe lines until that they divide the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lines drawn from the point O: for example, having from the point O drawn the line paſſing by the Angle of the Plane D; if one draw from the point C, a line paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by the ſame Angle elevated; this ſhall divide the other at the point H, and the point H ſhall be the ſhadow of this Angle. If from the point C, we do the ſame by all the Angles elevated, we ſhall divide the lines of the Plane, at the points H I K L, the which points we muſt joyn with right lines, and we ſhall have the ſhadow of the Cube, as is to be ſeen at the Figure above, and more clearly at that below.</p>

               <p>THE Sun, that glorious lightſom body, being far greater then the whole Globe of the Earth, as I have already ſaid in the beginning of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, ſhould make all its ſhadows in point, ſeeing that he doth always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten more then the half.</p>
               <p>In purſuit of this demonſtration we ſhould conclude, that all the ſhadows of the Sun ought to be leſs then the Body that is oppoſed unto it, and to diminiſh as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveth it ſelf far off: which would be true, if there were any correſpondency of the Body enlightned, to the Body enlightning: but all the Objects which are upon Earth, are ſo ſmall a thing in reſpect of this great light, that the diminution of their ſhadows is unperceivable by our eyes, which acknowledged them all equal, that is to ſay, that they are neither larger nor ſtreighter, then the Bodies that give them their ſhape; for this reaſon, we give all the ſhadows cauſed by the Sun by Parallels, as we have ſeen at the ſecond Figure of this Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>It followeth from all this diſcourſe, that for to have the ſhadow of what body ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, being oppoſed to the Sun, we muſt draw a line from above this great light, which may fall plumb at the place where one would take the foot of the light; and from this place to draw an occult line by one of the Angles of the Plane of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and another of the Sun by the ſame Angle elevated, and the ſection of theſe two lines ſhall ſhew how far the ſhadow muſt go, all the other lines ſhall be drawn Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel unto theſe.</p>
               <p>For example, for to take the ſhadow of the Cube A, the Sun being at B, we muſt from under the Sun C, which is as the foot of the light, draw a line which toucheth an Angle of the Plane, as C D. Then from the o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p>EXperience teacheth us, that many ſtiles, or elevations of the ſame height; remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the one from the other, ceaſe not to give their ſhadows equal in the ſame time, I ſay in the ſame time, for they do lengthen or ſhorten themſelves, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Sun cometh near, or retireth himſelf, the which he doth every moment, ſeeing that he never ſtandeth ſtill.</p>
               <p>Wherefore when one deſireth to cauſe the ſhadow of ſome object to caſt, we muſt determine of the place of the Sun and the point under it, to draw from thence the two occult lines which give the term of the ſhadow, as here the Hedge-row A, giveth the point of its ſhadow in B, and if from the point B, you draw to the point of ſight C, this line B C ſhall be as well the ſhadow of the Hedge-row D, as of that A, and of all thoſe that ſhould be in the ſame line unto the point of ſight, and you muſt hold for a maxime, that the ſhadows do always keep the ſame point of ſight with the objects.</p>
               <p>Following this experience, that the objects of the ſame height do give the ſhadows equal, if one would give the ſhadow to the Hedge-rows E F, which are of the ſame height with A D; we muſt only take with a Compaſs the diſtance A B, and carry it to the foot of the Hedge-Row E, for to have E G; and from this point G, to draw to the point of ſight C, and to make always the ſame Practice, even when theſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys were prolonged infinitely.</p>
               <p>But if the light come from the bottom, or from before, as in the figure below, muſt we change the Order? No, we moſt only ſet forward or draw back the foot, or that under the Sun, and draw lines from the one and from the other by an Angle, as are H and I, which ſhall give the bound of the ſhadow of the Hedge-Row K, to the point L; and from this point L we muſt draw to the point of ſight M: Then from all the Angles of the Plane of the Paliſſades, we muſt draw Parallels to the line H, unto the Ray L M, and we ſhall have the natural ſhadows of the ſame Paliſſades or Hedge-Rows.</p>

               <p>For example, when we would find the ſhadow of the Cube A, we muſt by the Angles of its plane B C, draw Rays to the point of ſight D, as are B E, C F. Then from the center of the Sun G, draw alſo two Rays, which ſhall divide thoſe at the point K L, paſſing by the ends of the lines elevated from the angles B and C, which are H and I: In ſuch manner as the ſhadow of this Cube ſhall be B K L C.</p>
               <p>The ſhadows of the two other pieces M and N, ſhall be taken by the ſame order, and ſo of all the others, which may there be met withall.</p>
               <p>It cometh into my mind, that one might be troubled, if inſtead of a Cube, there were a Pyramide: by reaſon that the Ray of the midſt of the plane of the Pyramide, and the Ray of the Sun, that paſſeth by the point, made but one line, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence can terminate nothing for to take the ſhadow from the point of this Pyramide.</p>
               <p>When this ſhall happen, we muſt from an Angle of the plane, as is here O, draw a Ray to the point of ſight P, which ſhall make O Q: And from the ſame Angle O, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate a Perpendicular O S, then from the point of the Pyramide T, make a parallel to the baſe, until that it divide the Perpendicular O S, at the point V: We muſt make the Ray of the Sun to paſs by this point V, and continue it until that it divide the Ray O Q, at the point X, from this point X, we muſt make a parallel to the baſe, unto the Ray of the midſt of the Pyramide, which ſhall be divided at the point Y, the bound of the ſhadow: We muſt draw to this point Y, from the Angles Z and O, and the Triangle Z Y O, ſhall be the ſhadow of the Pyramide.</p>

               <p>Although that I have made the Sun to appear in the other figures, we muſt not think that he ſhould be ſo near the Objects; it hath bin only for to give to underſtand, that the Rays do come from thence, whenas he is in this height: but nevertheleſs, out of the Piece, as in this ſecond Figure, which yet ceaſeth not, have the line from under the Sun A B, and that of the Ray of the Sun C, by reaſon that we ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to ſuppoſe them for to finde the bound of the ſhadow.</p>

               <p>For example, the figure being naked, or cloathed, and without a Cloak, as the firſt that turneth the back to us: We muſt from under its feet A, draw a line to the point of ſight B, and upon this line A B, make to fall occult lines from all the points which can help to find the true ſhadow: as from the hand C, to make to fall a Plumb-line, which ſhall divide the line A B at the point D, and from the Elbow E, to make one fall to the point F, and yet another from the head G, which ſhall give the point H, from all theſe points D F H, from the feet of the figure, and from the end of his Staff I. We muſt draw parallels to the baſe.</p>
               <p>Then the height of the Sun being determined of, we muſt draw a line, as K, paſſing by the fore-part, touching the brim of the Hat G, and to continue the ſame, until that it divide the line H, at the point L, which ſhall be the end of the ſhadow. And alſo from the brim behind his Hat M, to draw a parallel to K G L, until that it di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide alſo the line H, at the point N, theſe points N L, ſhall be the ſhadow of the Hat.

I believed that I ſhould oblige, I gave an Invention to draw them readily the one and the other.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid elſewhere, how we ſhould draw Parallels to the baſe, by the means of a Board well ſquared, as this here A, and of a Rule as B, the which ſhall ſerve to draw lines from under the Sun, when it meeteth directly oppoſite to the face of the Object, as may be the line C D; but if it enlighten by the Angle, we muſt uſe another inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as that marked E, which is a Rule faſtned to the End of another piece of Wood well ſquared, and hollowed of one ſide and the other, in ſuch manner that the Rule F G, may move with force, to the end that having taken a line bended as H D, one may therby make one which may be Parallel to it, which is I K with this falſe ſquare or Graſhoper, it is ſo as the Workmen call it E F G; this Inſtrument doth abbreviate exceedingly, when one would make ſhadows of the Sun, for there is not a line, and of what inclination ſoever it be, whereof one may not draw Parallels. The uſe will make us to know its profitableneſs.</p>

               <p>I Have already ſaid, that for to finde the ſhadows, we muſt neceſſarily have two points, the one from the foot of the Torch, or of the Candle, or of the Lamp, which ought always to be found upon the Plane, where the Object is ſet: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the flame of one of theſe lights.</p>
               <p>From the firſt point, which is the foot of the Torch, the bottom of the Lamp or of the Candle, we muſt draw Rays by all the Angles of the plane of the Object, of which one would have the ſhadow: And the ſecond point, which is the flame, will give other Rays, which paſſing by the Angles from the top of the Objects, will go to divide theſe lines drawn from the plane, and to mark where the ſhadow muſt end it ſelf: I ſhall ſhew this by example, uſing the ſame Letters, for theſe three lights, in which it ſhall be eaſie to ſee, that it is all the ſame order, in the one, as in the other, with this only difference, that the foot of the Torch, or of the Taper is ſet below, and that it muſt ſuppoſe in others that they ſet it there.</p>
               <p>I ſay then, that if one would have the ſhadows B, of the Cubes A, that we muſt from the point O, foot of the light, draw lines by all the Angles of the planes of theſe Cubes, as O D, O E, O F, O G, Then from the point C, which is the light, or the fire of theſe Luminaries, draw other lines, which muſt paſs by the Angles of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects elevated, and continue theſe lines, until that they divide the other lines drawn from the point O.</p>
               <p>For example, having drawn a line from the point O, paſſing by the Angle of the plane D, if one draw from the point C, another line paſſing by the ſame Angle eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted P, this of the point C being continued, ſhall divide the firſt of the corner D, at the point H, and this point H, ſhall be the ſhadow of this Angle D P.

               <p>For the foot of theſe lights, which muſt be upon all the Planes, where they ſet the Objects, they ſhall be found by this Method.</p>

               <p>The Torch being placed in A, this point A, is the foot of the light, and B the fire or the light of the Torch; this fire or light B remaineth firm and never changeth, but the foot muſt be found on all ſides.</p>
               <p>For to have the foot of the light at the wall on the ſide C, we muſt from the point A draw a Parallel to the baſe; until that it divide the Ray D E at the point F, and from the point F to raiſe a Perpendicular F G; Then from the point B, which is the fire, to draw another Parallel to the baſe until that it divide F G at the point H, and this point H ſhall be the foot of the light, as if the Torch were lying, by reaſon that its fire remaineth always at the point B.</p>
               <p>For to finde this foot of light at the Board above, we muſt from the point G draw a Parallel to the baſe as G I, and from the point B to make a Perpendicule to G I, which ſhall give the point K, which ſhall be the point of the foot of the light, as if the Torch were turned upſide down.</p>
               <p>For to finde it on the other ſide of the Hall, we muſt make the ſame Order as on the ſide C, and we ſhall have the point L.</p>
               <p>For to finde the foot of the light at the bottom of the Hall, we muſt from the point H draw to the point of ſight O, until that we divide the Perpendicule E at the point M; then from this point M to make a Parallel to the baſe, which ſhall divide the Torch at the point N, this point ſhall be the foot of the light for the bottom of the Hall.</p>
               <p>The foot of the Candle is found by the ſame Order, as that of the Torch, taking the midſt of the foot of the Candleſtick for the foot of the light; but when it is a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For example, in the Plate P, we muſt by the branch Q draw a Perpendicular to the baſe, as R S; then from the fire T to make a ſmall Parallel to the baſe, which ſhall divide R S at the point V, which ſhall be the foot of the light for this ſide, the point X ſhall be it for the board below, the point Y for the board above, and Z for the bottom of the Hall or Chamber.</p>
               <p>For the Lamp, it is the place where it is faſtned, which determineth its foot, as here *, from which place they draw a Parallel to the baſe unto the firſt Ray, and alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the ſame as at the Torch, and at the Candl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>For to finde the ſhadow of Round Objects, by a Torch.</head>
               <p>HAving made the fore-going figure, it came into my mind, that one might be in trouble, if there ſhould be Bowles, Cups, Viols, Flagons, or other round pieces (which have Ordinarily more breadth above then below) of the which we would have the ſhadow by a Torch; by reaſon that ſuch pieces ſeem more difficult then the ſquares, although that in effect, it be all the ſame Order there being nothing but to reduce the ſquare into round ſo as I, have taught in the fol. 19. 20. 28. 29 and 86: Where we ſhall ſee all the Orders for to ſet the Planes of round pieces into Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective; the which being known, all the reſt is very eaſy to underſtand.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid already at fol. 138, how we muſt finde the Plane of a Bowle, and by this Plane, to have juſtly the greatneſs of the ſhadow by the Sun: But as this of the Torch is different from that; I believed it to be neceſſary to ſet that alſo down here by reaſon that it doth facilitate the Order of all the other Rounds.</p>
               <p>For the ſhadow of this Bowle, I ſay then, that having made its Roundneſs with a Compaſs, which is the the Circle A, and draw his Diameter B C, that we muſt under this Circle make a line Parallel to B C, which toucheth the Circle at the point H, then from the ends of the Diameter B C, to Cauſe Perpendiculars to fall upon this line un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath, as B D, and C E, of the which points D E, we ſhall frame the ordinary way the Plane D E F G, whereof the diameter F G, ſhall divide this D E, at the point H; This Plane D E F G, ſhall ſerve for to finde ſhadow of this Bowle A. For after having drawn from the Foot of the Light I, lines which touch this plane on the one ſide and other, as are the lines I K and I L; And alſo another line paſſing by the midſt of the plane H, which ſhall be the line I H M. We muſt afterwards draw other lines from the Light of the Candle N, which touching the Bowle ſhall go to divide theſe lines of the Plane, as from the point N, to draw a line, which toucheth the Bowle between A and B, and divideth the line I H, at the point M, which ſhall be the end of the ſhadow: for to have the beginning of this ſhadow we muſt from the ſame point N, draw another line which toucheth the fore-part of the Bowle, and divideth alſo the line I H, at the point Q: this diſtance Q M, ſhall be the length of the ſhadow, for its bredth, we muſt alſo from the point N, draw two lines by the ends of the Diameter of the Bowle Z Z, and they ſhall divide the lines I K, at the point R, and this I L, at the point S. Wherfore if R S, be the bredth of the ſhadow, and Q M, the length, we have only to joyn theſe fower letters of Crooked lines, which ſhall give an Ovall, for the ſhadrw of the Bowle A</p>
               <p>I have a little Extended my ſelf for to facilitate the ſhadow of this Bowle, by reaſon that I believe this only Order ſufficient for to finde the ſhadow of other Rounds, as of the Figure V, the which having two breadths unequall, ought to have a Plane of two Circles. And that below X, which hath three differences, obligeth to make a Plane of three Circles; The one for the Neck of the Viol, or Flagon, the other for its Belly and the other for the foot: all theſe Planes are made as of the Bowle. I believe that it not neceſſary to uſe Repe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>One might object to me that Experience cauſeth it to be ſeen every day, that when the Rays of the Sun enter within an Hall, or a Chamber: the ſhadow of the Floores and of other things ceaſe not to appear; To which I anſwer, that then this ſhadow, or theſe ſhadows, is not, or are not of the Sun, but cauſed by the great Brightneſs of the Sun; and ſuch ſhadows might not be given by Parallels, as thoſe of the Sun, but by Rays from one and the ſame Center; as thoſe of a Torch, taking the Window where the Sun paſſeth, or the place where it giveth, for the point of the light, and to do for ſuch ſhadow, as I am ſaying of the ſhadow of a Torch.</p>
               <p>The Orders aforegoing which oblige to make Planes and to draw lines by all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, for to finde the bound of the ſhadows, would be too long for this, and the great Number of lines, which one muſt draw there, would make this figure very difficult, by reaſon of the Number of Beames and Joyſts which there are met with: the which made me ſeek the Means to abridge it, for to make is eaſie in the practiſe, without going forth of Rules and Maximes of Art</p>
               <p>Having made the floore in Perſpective, as it is taught in the 55th or 57 fol. And placed the Candle, the Torch, or the Lampe, in what place we would. We muſt ſearch by the means of the foot of the light, the place where the fire ought to to be, or to ſpeak more truly, the which we ſhall uſe in ſtead of the fire, for from this point to lines, which paſs under the Object, and mark out the bound of the ſhadows.</p>
               <p>For to have this point of fire, the light being at B, we muſt from the foot of the light C, draw a Parallel to the Baſe D E, untill that it cut the Ray E F, at the point G, from this point G, we muſt elevate a Perpendicule G L. Then from the fire of the Torch B, draw a Parallel to D E, which ſhall divide the Perpendicular G L, at the point L, and this point L, ſhall ſerve for the point of fire, which ſhall give the place and the length of the ſhadow.</p>
               <p>For Example, having to finde the ſhadow of the Beame A, we muſt from the point L, make a line to paſs under the Angle which is towards us as H, and ſee where this line L H, ſhall divide the firſt Joyſt, at the point I, for this ſhall be the place where the ſhadow of the Beame endeth: from this point I, we muſt draw a parallel I K, and marke upon the Joyſts the place of the ſhadow O, for the ſhadow of the ſpace of the Joyſts, ir will be found by drawing alſo a line from the point L, by the Angle of the firſt Joyſt M, which ſhall divide the Angle of the Hollow at the point N, from this point N, making a Parallel N P, we ſhall have all the ſhadow marked Q, for the Beame A.</p>
               <p>For to finde the ſhadow of Joyſts, beſides that of the Beame, we muſt only draw a line of fire B, by the Angle S, untill that it divide the Bottome of the Floore at the point T, do the ſame to all the other Joyſts, and you ſhall finde the ſhadow longer at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtance from the fire. Having marked upon one Beame all the points T, we muſt from the point of ſight R, draw lines by each of theſe points, and we ſhall have juſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween all the other Beams, the ſhadow of the Joyſts as is to be ſeen at the points V.</p>
               <p>The figure below is the ſame with that above, with this difference, that this is ſhadowed and that the former is not, by reaſon that the ſhadow would have hindred to ſee the letters and the ſmall lines.

               <p>IT is to be believed, that my counſel will be followed that one ſhould not turn over the leaf for to learn the order which followeth; before they underſtand and remember well, that which went before Wherefore ſuppoſing that one underſtands well the order, that I have given at 139 fol. for to find the ſhadow by the Sun, for all the figures of ſuch poſtures as they may be: I have nothing to ſay for theſe, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the line below, which I make to ſerve for the plane, and all the other meaſures are taken jn one, as in the other. But becauſe that the Torch doth not render an equal ſhadow in breadth to the body that giveth its ſhape, as doth the Sun: We muſt take this advice, which is, that inſtead of drawing the llnes parallels, that one to the other, as they are in the ſhadows taken from the Sun, we muſt draw them all from the ſame point, as from a Center; that is to ſay, that all the lines, which are drawn by the plane, muſt be drawn from the foot of the light A, and thoſe above, and about the figure muſt be drawn from the point of fire B, in like manner as in all the other orders of the Torch, the which maketh me leave the reſt, that would be but tedious repetitions, ſeeing that the figure expreſſeth it of its ſelf.</p>

               <p>THe ſhadows taken by the Sun, do caſt themſelves always on the ſame ſide, and have ordinarily one and the ſame diſpoſition: it being impoſſible that the Sun ſhould cauſe at the ſame time, to caſt the ſhadow of one body towards the Weſt, and of another towards the Eaſt, it is very true that it doth this every day, the one in the morning, and the other in the evening, but in one and the ſame hour, it will never do it naturally.</p>
               <p>The which is done without failing, by the Torch, the Candle, or the Lamp: for in what place ſoever you ſet one of theſe lights, if there be many bodies about them, they will caſt their ſhadow diverſly, that is to ſay, that the one will caſt it to the Eaſt, the other to the Weſt, this to the North, that to the South: in ſhort on every ſide ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the bodies ſhall be ordered about the light, the foot of the which marked A, ſerveth them for a Center, whether all theſe ſhadows draw, and the fire B, marketh where they muſt end, although diverſly, by reaſon that the neareſt, have their ſhadow ſhorteſt, and thoſe that are farther off, caſt it more at length,</p>
               <p>Although that the ſecond figure hath not the light in the midſt, yet the order of theſe ſhadows ceaſeth not to be kept, as we ſee that they all draw to the foot of the light C, and that they are bounded by the point of fire D.</p>
